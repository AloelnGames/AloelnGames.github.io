How to set up your own hero slave.

-The default slave template used is defined in src/js/SlaveState.js

Making your slave; add their name to the following, then go down the documentation adding in your changes.
-each variable must be separated from the last by a comma followed by a space
-each variable must be assigned to _HS
-if your slave's variable matches the default, you do not have to list it
-strings MUST be in " or your slave will not compile properly

<<set _HS =  App.Entity.SlaveState.makeSkeleton()>>
<<set _HS.slaveName = "STANDARD", _HS.birthName = "STANDARD", _HS.ID = _i++>>
<<set $heroSlaves.push(_HS)>>

Once finished, add it into "customSlavesDatabase".
To test if your slave is functioning, start up a normal game, swap to cheat mode, max your rep, and view other slaveowner's stock in the slave market. If you cannot find your slave in the list, and you didn't start the game with your slave, you should double check your slave for errors. If a slave named "Blank" is present, then you likely messed up. Once you find your slave, check their description to make sure it is correct. If it is not, you messed up somewhere in setting them up.

wombJS.tw subsystem:

This is a womb processor/simulator script. It takes care of calculation of belly sizes based on individual fetus sizes, with full support of broodmothers implant random turning on and off possibility. Also this can be expanded to store more parents data in each individual fetus in future.
Should be initialized for all slaves not female only. Currently it's not affect pregnancy mechanic in game directly - it's addon for better sizes calculation, and optional mechanics for future usage.
Design limitations:
- Mother can't gestate children with different speeds at same time. All speed changes apply to all fetuses.
- Sizes of individual fetuses updated only on call of WombGetVolume - not every time as called WombProgress. This is for better overall code speed.
- For broodmothers we need actual "new ova release" code now. But it's possible to control how many children will be added each time, and so - how much children is ready to birth each time.


For new generated slaves automatically called WombInit function to do initial setup. But it's can be called at any time "just in case", if code need to be completely sure that womb exists and correctly initialized. If .preg and pregType is set above 0 at time of call with empty womb array - fetuses will be generated too.


Pregnancy control, best practices ($activeSlave used as sample, can be any slave related variable or $PC for player character):

Impregnation:

<<set WombImpregnate($activeSlave, 3, -1, 15)>>
$activeSlave, 3 fetuses, -1 - player is father, 15 week is initial time for fetuses. Can be used on already pregnant slaves (broodmothers use it).
<<SetSlaveBelly $activeSlave>>
Last line needed only if you need to show description with changed state immediately, an advanced initial pregnancy time set (showing already).

Advancing pregnancy:

<<set WombProgress($activeSlave, 1)>>
Advancing 1 week. Normally it's called by End Week processing for all slaves. Old method with using .preg++ on slave supported too, but better to use this new.

Birth checking:

<<if WombBirthReady($activeSlave, 40) > 0>>
Check if we have any babies in womb with is at minimum 40 week of gestation age? Age can be any.

Birthing:

<<set _babies = WombBirth($activeSlave, 34)>>
In array _babies will be placed all babies from womb of $activeSlave who gestation age at least 34 weeks (can be any). Others will be leaved in womb.
Optionally:
<<set WombFlush($activeSlave)>>
Will empty womb. You also still should set .preg .pregType .pregSource .pregWeek to 0, or call WombNormalizePreg.
_babies here become normal array - we can do with it as with any other array in sugarcube. _babies.length - size, _babies[0] - first element, etc. Contains all babies object, with their age, sex, volume/size, and father ID. Right now - not used anywhere but useful for possible incubator improvements in future at least.

Usage reference without sugarcube code (samples):

WombInit($slave) - before first pregnancy, at slave creation, of as backward compatibility update. Can generate proper pregnancy based on preg, pregType, and pregSource properties too. Can be little glitchy with broodmothers in this case, if their preg != pregType (or pregType can't be divided by preg with integer result).

WombImpregnate($Slave, $fetus_count, $fatherID, $initial_age) - should be added after normal impregnation code, with already calculated fetus count. ID of father - can be used in future for processing children from different fathers in one pregnancy. Initial age normally 1 (as .preg normally set to 1), but can be raised if needed. Also should be called at time as broodmother implant add another fetus(es), or if new fetuses added from other sources in future (transplanting maybe?)

WombProgress($slave, $time_to_add_to_fetuses) - after code that update $slave.preg, time to add should be the same.

$isReady = WombBirthReady($slave, $birth_ready_age) - how many children ready to be birthed if their time to be ready is $birth_ready_age (40 is for normal length pregnancy). Return int - count of ready to birth children, or 0 if no ready exists.

$children = WombBirth($slave, $birth_ready_age) - for actual birth. Return array with fetuses objects that birthed (can be used in future) and remove them from womb array of $slave. Should be called at actual birth code in sugarcube. fetuses that not ready remained in womb (array).

WombFlush($slave) - clean womb (array). Can be used at broodmother birthstorm or abortion situations in game. But birthstorm logically should use WombBirth($slave, 35) or so before - some children in this event is live capable, others is not.

$slave.bellyPreg = WombGetWolume($slave) - return double, with current womb volume in CC - for updating $slave.bellyPreg, or if need to update individual fetuses sizes.

_time = WombMinPreg($activeSlave) - age of most young fetus in womb.

_time = WombMaxPreg($activeSlave) - age of most old fetus in womb.

WombUpdatePregVars($activeSlave) - automatically update $activeSlave.preg, $activeSlave.pregType, $activeSlave.bellyPreg to actual values based on womb fetuses.

WombNormalizePreg($activeSlave) - automatically correct all pregnancy related properties of given $activeSlave. Also it advances pregnancy if detected old .preg++ method used on slave and womb simulation is late. Can be called at any time without conditions checks - function do all needed checks by itself. Call of this function do NOT advance pregnancy by itself.

WombZeroID($activeSlave, _SlaveID) - automatically scan all fetuses and if their father ID matched - it will be replaced with zero. After it actor pregnancy related variables (like .pregSource) will be updated. Used mainly in process of removing slaves from game, to clean father's ID of unborn children of remaining slaves.

All this womb system can be much more automated (.preg .pregType .pregSource .pregWeek may have to be done in a way, that they will have no need to be controlled manually anywhere at all. Just will be set fully automatically). But in this case many changes in present game code needed, to REMOVE legacy code.
Right now they are set correctly, based on state of .womb object through pregnancy, but not outside. Also old style pregnancy initiation (setting only .preg to >0 and .pregType to >=1 ) working too - WombImpregnation function for proper setup of .womb will be called on next SetBellySize call. Also old style pregnancy progression through using .preg++ is supported too, but can have minor issues with character descriptions in some cases, if SetBellySize widget not called before descriptions widgets.


Advanced pregnancy control structure:

Now, with support of human-animal pregnancy, there is need for ability to change values that been constant before. New structure designed for it.

.pregData property for slave should now contain object with describable pregnancy process. By default it will be set to human data. Templates stored in setup.pregData.x where "x" - name of species.

<<set slave.pregData = setup.pregData.human>>

In code at any time properties that contain data can be accessed now. Properties is RW, so slaves can be changed individually later. Example:

<<if slave.pregData.type == "human">>
or
<<set slave.pregData.normalOvaMin = 2, slave.pregData.normalOvaMax = 4>> (setting normal ova count 2-4 on every ovulation).

	Property list:

	type			- name of species. Should math slave.ovaType
	normalOvaMin	- normal/base ova count on ovulation (minimal)
	normalOvaMax	- normal/base ova count on ovulation (maximal)
	normalBirth		- typical normal pregnancy length in weeks
	minLiveBirth	- typical weeks that guarantee at least 90% chance to fetus survival if normal birth occur.
	fetusWeek		- array with weeks control points.
	fetusSize		- array with size control points.
	fetusCTR		- array with CTR control points.

	These three array is linked, and values in second and third should be in the same order as in first. (Week of .fetusWeek[i] is correspond to .fetusSize[i] and fetusCTR[i])
	Control points - it's points of graph as if it built on paper (one axis - fetusWeek, other - fetusSize/fetusCTR). This graph data is used to get actual size of fetus, so no need for manual setting of every week data in array.

	What is CTR? In most medical data, human fetus size (length) measured as "crown to rump" from 1 to 20 weeks, and "crown to heel" later. Formula that calculate volume of womb should get data in single format. So there is need CTR rate - value that describe difference between full "crown to heel" and "crown to rump" length of fetus (also it's can be used to control approximation of legs, hands and tails volume). For most animal fetus data it's always 1 as they are not bipedal and "crown to rump" is natural measurements for them. But CTR rate changes might be needed to get more accurate results for volume calculations, as fetus is not sphere and length - not always have the same relation to it's volume.
