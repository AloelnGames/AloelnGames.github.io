Neither slave wants to make the first move, especially with the drowning cacophony coming from the jeering crowd. Slowly, _winner.slaveName moves forward, waving $his sword side to side in the hopes of finding $his opponent before $he $himself gets found. _loser.slaveName's sword clips the tip of _winner.slaveName's setting off a surprisingly brutal series of slashes. The two slaves violently lay into each other, suffering more and more strikes as the struggle goes on. Less than a minute from first contact, both slaves are lying in their combined blood. As you begin to call it a draw, you notice _winner.slaveName start to stir. $He staggers to $his feet, coated in $his and _loser.slaveName's blood, before dropping back to $his knees. It seems $he lived through this fight; odds aren't likely $he'll do it again.

It also dodges the next few slashes before coming to a standstill. With a furious growl, it runs around $him, just out of reach of $his sword, before jumping at the wall of $pitName and launching itself off. Its <<if _animal.type == "canine">>teeth<<else>>claws<</if>> connect with _loser.slaveName's throat, completely severing $his windpipe. $He falls to $his knees, eyes wide and clutching $his throat, before completely collapsing.

					The _animal.species paws at the ground for a few seconds before launching itself at $activeSlave.slaveName. $He just barely manages to get out of the way, and the _animal.species has to backpedal to avoid smashing into the wall. $activeSlave.slaveName isn't out of danger just yet, though â€” $he is still standing directly behind the _animal.species. $He realizes this too late, as both of the its hooves connect with $his jaw. With a sickening //crunch//, $he flies backwards, $his body slamming into the other wall of $pitName.
