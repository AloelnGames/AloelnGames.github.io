<<= App.UI.slaveDescriptionDialog($activeSlave)>> is an incredible producer of milk. $He's lactating in volumes that would have been unthinkable in the days when drug treatments were limited by consent. A nascent slave dairy trade organization will be holding a public stock show tomorrow, and since they're aware you keep cows, they've sent you an invitation to enter stock to be judged.

<br><br>

This is a rare opportunity. The idea of human dairy is new and understandably fascinating to many, so the stock show is likely to draw some serious press. Were $activeSlave.slaveName to win, $he would probably be remembered for a long time as a special cow.

It's likely there was some bribery behind the scenes, and it is fatal to $his chances of winning.
