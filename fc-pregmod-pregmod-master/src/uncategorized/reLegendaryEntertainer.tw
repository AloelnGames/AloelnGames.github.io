The Free Cities fashion scene extends to slave bodies, of course; stopping at mere clothes and behaviors is an old world conceit. This week, <<= App.UI.slaveDescriptionDialog($activeSlave)>> is in vogue. Such a crowd of gawkers and hangers-on follows $him around the club that the fine citizens who have a chance at an hour of $his time must shoulder their way through the throng.

<br><br>

This is a rare opportunity. Such popularity and fame is here today, and gone tomorrow. It might be possible, with a serious investment of funds in publicity, to really fix $him in the public mind as a courtesan of note. There's no guarantee of success, but if you are successful, $his value will increase a great deal.
