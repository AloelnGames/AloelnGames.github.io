<<if _seed == 1>>
	The hare knows that once _his2 knees touched the field, _his2 chance at freedom was gone. _He2 begins to cry
	<<if $phallus == "huge dick">>
		and then scream as $activeLurcher.slaveName
		<<if $origin == "virgin">>
			rapes _his2 virgin ass. The lurcher has to fuck the slave to claim _him2 for you, and $he knows that a virgin pussy is more valuable than a virgin rosebud. $He has to be very careful, since $his cock is big enough to seriously hurt an anal virgin, but despite $his care the racket is appallingly loud.
		<<elseif $origin == "heavily pregnant">>
			fucks _his2 cunt. As _his2 belly attests, _he2's no virgin, but the lurcher's dick is big enough to reach _his2 cervix. _His2 screams crescendo into shrieks as _he2 experiences this internal torment.
		<<elseif $origin == "housewife">>
			fucks _him2 in the ass. A kept _woman2 like _him2 is probably no stranger to giving up _his2 butthole to please a cock, but _he2 apparently isn't used to dick quite this formidable. The lurcher leaves _him2 sobbing disconsolately with a fresh load of cum leaking out of _his2 backdoor.
		<<elseif $origin == "feminized">>
			fucks _him2 in the ass. The high-pitched shrieking produces some discussion in the crowd. If the slave didn't want huge cock up _his2 girly anus, why did _he2 feminize _himself2 so thoroughly? A mystery.
		<<elseif $origin == "huge balled">>
			fucks _him2 in the ass. The lurcher pounds _him2 doggy style, taking nice long strokes that slide $his formidable shaft almost all the way out of $his victim's poor butthole before shoving it back in again. The slave's balls brush the field with each thrust.
		<<else>>
			fucks _him2 in the ass. _He2 never stops struggling, though this isn't much proof of undiminished resistance. After all, the lurcher's dick is so big that _he2'd probably fight to get it out of _his2 butthole even if _he2 weren't in need of breaking.
		<</if>>
	<<elseif $phallus == "dick">>
		as $activeLurcher.slaveName
		<<if $origin == "virgin">>
			penetrates _his2 virgin ass. The lurcher has to fuck the slave to claim _him2 for you, and $he knows that a virgin pussy is more valuable than a virgin rosebud. You see $his back stiffen with overstimulation as $he experiences the rare delight of raping an anal virgin.
		<<elseif $origin == "heavily pregnant">>
			uses _his2 cunt. The lurcher pulls the slave upright so $he can cradle _his2 pregnant belly while $he fucks _him2. When _he2 climaxes, $he thrusts as deeply as $he can manage, though more cum won't make the slave any more pregnant.
		<<elseif $origin == "housewife">>
			fucks _him2 in the ass. _His2 tears seem to come more from disappointment than anal pain; a kept _woman2 like _him2 has probably put up with more than one buttfuck _he2 didn't want.
		<<elseif $origin == "feminized">>
			fucks _him2 in the ass. The whining produces some discussion in the crowd. If the slave didn't want cock up _his2 girly anus, why did _he2 feminize _himself2 so thoroughly? A mystery.
		<<elseif $origin == "huge balled">>
			uses _his2 anus. With them facing away from you, the coupling takes the usual stacked symmetry of a dickgirl fucking a dickgirl, though the bottom's generous balls sway eye-catchingly back and forth with the rhythm of the assrape.
		<<else>>
			fucks _him2 in the ass. _He2 never stops struggling, which is eloquent proof of the slave's undiminished resolve to resist _his2 lot in life. _He2's probably been assraped more than once before today, but _he2 fights this like it's the first time.
		<</if>>
	<<elseif $phallus == "clit">>
		as $activeLurcher.slaveName
		<<if $origin == "virgin">>
			grinds $himself against the hare to get $his pseudophallic clit into $his victim's virgin ass. The lurcher has to fuck the slave to claim _him2 for you, and $he knows that a virgin pussy is more valuable than a virgin rosebud. You see $his back stiffen with overstimulation as $his enormous bitch button slips up the slave's asshole.
		<<elseif $origin == "heavily pregnant">>
			grinds $himself against the hare to get $his pseudophallic clit inside $his victim's cunt. The lurcher has to force the hare down, legs spread, in order to work $his enormous clit inside the slave, but $he manages it and you see $his back stiffen as $his pseudophallus, small by the standards of penises but much more sensitive, slides inside.
		<<elseif $origin == "housewife">>
			grinds $himself against the hare to get $his pseudophallic clit inside $his victim's cunt. The slave doesn't seem to know what to make of this. Being raped by a huge clit is very probably a novel experience for _him2, but it isn't really painful. _He2 closes _his2 eyes and visibly tries to pretend it's a small penis.
		<<elseif $origin == "feminized">>
			grinds $himself against the hare to get $his pseudophallic clit inside $his victim's experienced anus. The slave stiffens with shock. _He2's obviously had quite a variety of things pushed up _his2 girly butthole, but apparently this is _his2 first time being fucked by a clit.
		<<elseif $origin == "huge balled">>
			grinds $himself against the hare to get $his pseudophallic clit inside $his victim's asshole. The slave stiffens with shock. Though it's huge by the standards of clitorises, the pseudophallus isn't big enough to make assrape painful, but the extreme inversion of gender roles makes up for it, to go by the slave's horror.
		<<else>>
			grinds $himself against the hare to get $his pseudophallic clit inside $his victim's asshole. The slave never stops struggling, which is eloquent proof of the slave's undiminished resolve to resist _his2 lot in life. _He2's probably been assraped by much larger phalli, but _he2 fights it anyway.
		<</if>>
	<<elseif $phallus == "dildo">>
		as $activeLurcher.slaveName
		<<if $origin == "virgin">>
			inserts $his dildo into the slave's virgin ass. The lurcher has to fuck the slave to claim _him2 for you, and $he knows that a virgin pussy is more valuable than a virgin rosebud. The dildo is reasonably sized and well lubricated, but the poor slave shrieks with anal pain anyway.
		<<elseif $origin == "heavily pregnant">>
			pushes $his dildo inside the slave's fertile cunt. Desperate to preserve _his2 baby, the slave complies as best _he2 can. Taking the cue, your lurcher caresses _him2, producing a grotesque parody of loving pregnant sex that holds the crowd's attention.
		<<elseif $origin == "housewife">>
			pushes $his dildo up the slave's ass. A kept _woman2 like _him2 is not likely to be any stranger to sex toys, but to go by _his2 reaction, _he2 probably prefers to put them in _his2 cunt.
		<<elseif $origin == "feminized">>
			pushes $his dildo up the slave's sissy ass. The whining produces some discussion in the crowd. Why would a _girl2 who feminized _himself2 so thoroughly have any problem with something being shoved inside _his2 rear pussy? A mystery.
		<<elseif $origin == "huge balled">>
			pushes $his dildo up the slave's ass. Knowing that $he should do $his best to create a spectacle, $he takes the slave's dangling balls in one hand, squeezing them to force $his bottom to be a good little butthole bitch, and then stimulating them until the slave achieves a shameful anal orgasm.
		<<else>>
			pushes $his dildo up the slave's ass. The slave never stops struggling, which is eloquent proof of the slave's undiminished resolve to resist _his2 lot in life. _He2's probably had several dildos pushed up _his2 disobedient asshole, but it seems _he2's determined to learn nothing.
		<</if>>
	<<else>>
		as $activeLurcher.slaveName hesitates over _him2. The lurcher realizes that $he won't be able to get hard. Desperate to avoid failure, $he
		<<if $origin == "virgin">>
			shoves a couple of fingers into the slave's virgin ass. $He has to fuck the slave to claim _him2 for you, and $he knows that a virgin pussy is more valuable than a virgin rosebud.
		<<elseif $origin == "heavily pregnant">>
			gives up and fingerfucks the pregnant _girl2. Desperate to preserve _his2 baby, the slave complies as best _he2 can, producing a contest between _his2 attempts to go along and the lurcher's attempts to make it unpleasant. This degenerates into a sobbing cunt fisting session.
		<<elseif $origin == "housewife">>
			shoves a couple of fingers up the slave's ass. A kept _woman2 like _him2 is not likely to be any stranger to a little anal play, but _he2 doesn't seem to be much of a fan. _He2 does _his2 best to relax, but it's obvious that _he2 doesn't appreciate having _his2 asshole fingered.
		<<elseif $origin == "feminized">>
			shoves $his fingers up the slave's sissy ass. It's so loose that this fails to have the desired effect. Afraid that $he has to produce some sort of reaction, the lurcher shoves $his entire fist up there, producing a wail of anal anguish.
		<<elseif $origin == "huge balled">>
			shoves a couple of fingers up the slave's ass. Casting about for something to do to distract from $his inadequacy, the lurcher seizes the slave's dangling balls and shoves one of them up _his2 loosened butt. This produces a shriek of pain and surprise, followed by a long fight to get the other one up there.
		<<else>>
			shoves a couple of fingers up the slave's ass. The slave never stops struggling, producing nothing more interesting than an extended wrestling match in which one of the parties has some fingers inside the other's butthole.
		<</if>>
		The crowd is unimpressed by this disappointing display.
