The Free Cities red light areas are so overcharged with cheap and easy sex that the fashion in whores is comically unstable. This week, <<= App.UI.slaveDescriptionDialog($activeSlave)>> is in vogue. So many customers are interested in renting $his body that it's necessary to assign other whores to take some of the load off $him by diverting less important customers away from $him.

<br><br>

This is a rare opportunity. Such popularity and fame is here today, and gone tomorrow. It might be possible, with a serious investment of funds in publicity, to really fix $him in the public mind as a whore of note. There's no guarantee of success, but if you are successful, $his value will increase a great deal.
