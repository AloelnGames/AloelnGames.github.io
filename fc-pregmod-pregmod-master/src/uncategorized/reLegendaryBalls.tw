<<= App.UI.slaveDescriptionDialog($activeSlave)>> is an incredible producer of cum. $He's producing in volumes that would have been unthinkable in the days when it was illegal to restrain a slave so that $he could have every drop of $his ejaculate milked out by a machine. A nascent slave stock organization will be holding a public livestock show tomorrow, and since they're aware you're experimenting with cockmilking, they've sent you an invitation to enter an especially productive slave to be judged.

<br><br>

This is a rare opportunity. The idea of cockmilking is new and understandably fascinating to many, so the livestock show is likely to draw some serious press. Were $activeSlave.slaveName to win, $he would probably be remembered for a long time as a special slave.

It's likely there was some bribery behind the scenes, and it is fatal to $his chances of winning.

		$activeSlave.slaveName is shown in public, closely inspected by the judging committee, and then publicly cockmilked. Several of the judges cannot resist giving you a wink as they look $him over, but others look disapprovingly at them; it seems some of your competitors also forwarded money to the committee. After furious wrangling, $activeSlave.slaveName loses to another milker.
