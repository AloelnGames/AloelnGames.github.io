		<<case "Roman Revivalist">>
			is open and airy; a breeze wafts through the space, and Roman theories on natural cleanliness are very much on display.
		<<case "Aztec Revivalist">>
			is open and airy; a light hint of herbs and natural oil permeates the air. Everything is incredibly sterile, especially the blood management equipment.
		<<case "Egyptian Revivalist">>
			is open and airy; clean rushes are strewn across the floor, making a gentle susurration when anyone crosses the space.
		<<case "Edo Revivalist">>
			is clean and spartan to the point of featurelessness. Spotless tatami mats cover the floor, and partitions divide the space into cubicles.
		<<case "Arabian Revivalist">>
			is open and airy; a thin trail of smoke wafts through the space on a gentle breeze, coming from a brazier burning incense.
		<<case "Chinese Revivalist">>
			is open and airy; a thin trail of smoke wafts through the space on a gentle breeze, coming from a brazier burning medicinal herbs.
		<<case "Chattel Religionist">>
			is open and airy; shaded beams of sunlight shine through skylights to bathe each bed in a pool of healing warmth.
		<<case "Degradationist">>
			is clean and cold, all scrubbed tile and cool steel. The beds have prominent restraint attachment points to force patients into any position desired.
		<<case "Repopulation Focus">>
			is warm and inviting, with wide corridors and ample seating for its pregnant client√®le. All the equipment is designed to accommodate heavily pregnant women.
		<<case "Eugenics">>
			is warm and inviting on one side, cold and utilitarian on the other. Only the toys of the elite are allowed the best of care.
		<<case "Asset Expansionist">>
			is utilitarian, without any concession to style. Every available <<if $showInches == 2>>inch<<else>>centimeter<</if>> of space is used for equipment specialized to support growth.
		<<case "Transformation Fetishist">>
			is utilitarian, without any concession to style. Every available <<if $showInches == 2>>inch<<else>>centimeter<</if>> of space is used for equipment specialized to support radical surgery.
		<<case "Gender Radicalist">>
			is comfortable and feminine. Its curving walls and soft colors are designed to present slaves coming out of anesthesia with an impression of girlishness.
		<<case "Gender Fundamentalist">>
			is comfortable and feminine. Its curving walls and soft colors are designed to keep slaves here for their female health nice and comfortable.
		<<case "Physical Idealist">>
			is utilitarian, without any concession to style. Every available <<if $showInches == 2>>inch<<else>>centimeter<</if>> of space is used for some piece of equipment useful in making the human body faster or stronger.
		<<case "Supremacist">>
			is clean and cold, all scrubbed tile and cool steel. The only hint of its radical uses are the pseudoscientific racialist charts on the walls.
		<<case "Subjugationist">>
			is clean and cold, all scrubbed tile and cool steel. The only hint of its radical uses are the pseudoscientific racialist charts on the walls.
		<<case "Paternalist">>
			is warm and inviting, with curved walls and warm colors designed to put patients at their ease. Each bed is well provided with entertainment options.
		<<case "Pastoralist">>
			is utilitarian, without any concession to style. Every available <<if $showInches == 2>>inch<<else>>centimeter<</if>> of space is used for equipment specialized for human veterinary medicine.
		<<case "Maturity Preferentialist">>
			is comfortable and soothing, with curved walls and cool colors designed to keep patients relaxed. Each bed is provided with refined yet invariably pornographic entertainment options.
		<<case "Youth Preferentialist">>
			is bright and cheerful, with curved walls and pastel colors designed to keep patients in good spirits. Each bed is provided with light entertainment options.
		<<case "Body Purist">>
			is utilitarian, without any concession to style. Every available <<if $showInches == 2>>inch<<else>>centimeter<</if>> of space is filled with equipment designed to make medicine as low-impact as possible.
		<<case "Slimness Enthusiast">>
			is warm and inviting, with curved walls and warm colors designed to put patients at their ease. Each bed is well provided with entertainment options.
		<<case "Hedonistic">>
			is warm and comfortable, with extra wide, soft, heated beds and ample morphine. Pleasant smells are pumped into the recovery wards, plenty of entertainment is available and chubby nurse in a too small dress with a big bowl of slave food is only a button press away. It can be quite difficult to convince patients to leave.
		<<case "Intellectual Dependency">>
			is bright and cheerful, with plenty of simple amusements to keep bimbos distracted and in bed. A complex locking mechanism promises no chance of a slave wandering off to slake their lust.
		<<case "Slave Professionalism">>
			is clean and cold, all scrubbed tile and cool steel. Any delays in recovery are nothing more than time spent not honing one's talents.
		<<case "Petite Admiration">>
			is open and airy due to all the extra space freed up by shortening the beds. A footrest is the only accommodation made for tall slaves.
		<<case "Statuesque Glorification">>
			is warm and comfortable, if a little cramped; tall slaves require long beds, after all. A meager footstool is the only accommodation made for short slaves.
		<<default>>
			is a well-equipped modern medical facility. Each patient has their own area, with heavy automation to provide them treatment without any human intervention at all.
