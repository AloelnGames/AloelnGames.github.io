This call is coming from a public kiosk, which is usually an indication that the person on the other end is a transient individual who has decided to take slavery over homelessness. This proves to be right on the money in this case, though the $woman isn't too terribly bedraggled; $his situation must be recent. $He asks to be enslaved with the crushing sadness most such people experience during their last free hours. "I'm pregnant," $he says through tears. "I know I'm not that pretty, <<if $PC.title != 0>><<s>>ir<<else>>ma'am<</if>>.

This call is coming from a public kiosk, which is usually an indication that the person on the other end is a transient individual who has decided to take slavery over homelessness. You are understandably surprised when this turns out to not be the case; the $woman in the video call is modestly dressed, so $his newfound situation must be exceedingly recent. Nonetheless, $he asks to be enslaved with the same poignant sadness most people experience during their last free hours. "All my children are gone and my hu<<s>>band left me," $he says through tears.

You receive an urgent communication from one such private military company.
<br><br>
It seems that they've run into a serious cash flow problem. They may not have liquid assets, but they do have human assets. What they lack is the slaveholding and selling infrastructure to translate the latter into the former. They're interested in fencing some merchandise to you, no questions asked, on a flat fee basis. Included in the message is a slave dossier detailing the piece of human chattel they're offering.

<<case "Supremacist Two">>

Ever since you have been steering $arcologies[0].name towards a belief in $arcologies[0].FSSupremacistRace supremacy, you've been receiving increasingly useful communications from groups that share your ideals.

You receive a communication from one such group.

It seems that in a man in their town made the mistake of marrying a $woman of an undesirable racial background, and this group has stepped in to put an end to such a distasteful union. However, though they may be ruthless vigilantes, they don't consider themselves murderers. They're interested in fencing this former $wife to you, no questions asked, on a flat fee basis.

The $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace victim was publicly sodomized and left bruised and bleeding, $his clothes torn off, beaten into insensibility, with anti-$arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace slogans written crudely across $his $activeSlave.skin skin. It seems $he came into the arcology despite the strong penalties for free $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace subhumans found here.

"Being your <<s>>lave ha<<s>> to be better than being a <<s>>ubhuman here," $he says. "Being your <<s>>e<<x>> <<s>>lave i<<s>> more a<<cc>>epted in your <<c>>ity than being me i<<s>> here."

<<case "Gender Fundamentalist">>

The sexual and moral revolution taking place in the Free Cites has spread back into the old world, producing an inevitable reaction. Thus there are still many places in the world where it is socially embarrassing for one's young female relatives to appear pregnant and unmarried, and where direct solutions to this unfortunate situation are frowned upon. You receive a communication from one such place, from a traditionalist family whose $daughter has dishonored them in this way.
<br><br>
Having $him disappear discreetly into $arcologies[0].name would be a convenient and face-saving way of resolving the situation. Your society's respect for slave pregnancy gives them a plausible way to salve their own consciences where the baby is concerned. As for the $girl, having $him out of the way is what matters to them.

<br><br>
The face and voice are obscured by a petty anonymization program, the sort that can be obtained with five minutes' work in the shadier parts of the net. <<= capFirstChar($assistant.name)>> could crack it nearly instantaneously, but you hold _himA back a moment to avoid spooking your correspondent.

<br><br>
In lieu of a face, a plain page of mostly text and a scant few pictures fills the screen and details a number of potential slaves for sale, though most of the merchandise seems visibly too damaged to be worthy of purchase. Yet, one of the slaves catches your eye — an older $woman covered in lashes, bruises and marks yet absent the dead-eyed expression of $his peers. The document claims $he has been in their possession longer than any of the other slaves, but has proven resistant to their breaking methods.

One category of message that always gets through regardless of content, though, is requests for voluntary enslavement. As the new world takes shape, they've become less rare than they once were.
<br><br>
The call comes in from a middle-class area. It appears that the tired looking woman placing the call has a special needs child and can no longer continue to provide the care $he requires. Having $him disappear discreetly into $arcologies[0].name would be a convenient way of resolving the situation. Your society's tastes for the mentally slow gives them a plausible way to salve their own consciences on abandoning their child, while, at the same time, giving $him a home where $he can thrive.

<br><br>
This one, unusually, is voice-only. The caller seems extremely intoxicated as $he struggles to explain $his situation, and you're not far off on that assumption; $he overdosed on illicit drugs at a party and can't think straight any longer. $He apparently cannot remember where $he came from and is desperate for any sort of support, even if it means enslavement.

You are on the point of opening the a call with a friendly businesslike salutation when you see his haggard, worried face, and change your greeting to one of commiseration and understanding. He pours out his troubles to you in a rush.
<br><br>
It seems he botched an implant operation on a free $woman. $He's still out, and the implants are in successfully, but $he's not too far from dead and will remain so for some time. He needs $him out of sight, now. With your pull, you could easily manipulate the financial situation to enslave $him and get $him out of the doctor's area at the same time. It would be a favor to him, and by the medical records, a favor to you too, once you nurse $him back to health. $He's quite the implant queen.

You receive so many messages, as a noted titan of the new Free Cities world, that $assistant.name has to be quite draconian in culling them. _HeA lets only the most important through to you. One category of message that always gets through regardless of content, though, is requests for voluntary enslavement. As the new world takes shape, they've become less rare than they once were.
<br><br>
The call comes in from an unusually well-to-do area. It appears that an aristocratic-looking man placing the call has fallen on hard times, and is doing the intelligent thing and staying ahead of his creditors by offering his trophy $wife into slavery. Enslaving $him will be costlier than usual, but it seems likely to be worth it. $He's finely aged and completed worked over under a surgeon's knife. $He's quite the implant queen, in fact.

Enslaving $him will be costlier than usual, but it seems likely to be worth it. $He's well-spoken and seems both educated and intelligent. Even better, despite being middle-aged, $he's extremely well-preserved, a tall, slim and graceful beauty with a face that must be the envy of <<= $girl>>s half $his age. $He knows all this $himself, and <<say>>s, "I hear you appre<<c>>iate a <<s>>lender $woman; if I'm going down into <<s>>lavery, <<if $PC.title != 0>><<s>>ir<<else>>ma'am<</if>>, I'd be happy to avoid too many implant<<s>>.

This call is coming from a public kiosk, which is usually an indication that the person on the other end is a transient individual who has decided to take slavery over homelessness. You are understandably surprised when this turns out to not be the case; the young $woman in the video call is reasonably well dressed, so $his newfound situation must be exceedingly recent. Without hesitation $he immediately asks to be enslaved. "My boyfriend want<<s>> to turn me into <<s>>ome <<s>>ort of bimbo," $he <<say>>s through $his tears. "I found all the <<s>>urgery bro<<ch>>ure<<s>> that he hid, <<if $PC.title != 0>><<s>>ir<<else>>ma'am<</if>>.

The person placing the call is physically quite unusual, to the point of looking distinctly unnatural. $He has absolutely enormous tits, an ass to match, and is generally plush all over; yet despite being able to compete with the lushest mother in the curves department, $he appears to be very young. $He explains $himself quickly. "<<if $PC.title != 0>><<S>>ir<<else>>Ma'am<</if>>, I ju<<s>>t turned 19.

This one, unusually, is voice-only. The caller explains why in a painfully quiet voice: $he's turning $activeSlave.actualAge in the next few days, and $he's fairly certain $his family is about to sell $him into slavery. The mixed notes of despair, apathy, and fear in $his voice are heartrending, even to you. $He begs you to make the necessary arrangements to enslave $him. $He's heard about you and how you like young <<= $girl>>s, and $he's also heard about brothels and arcades.

This one, unusually, is voice-only. The caller explains why in an unusually upbeat voice: $he turned 18 a few days ago, and $he's fairly certain $his family is expecting $him to make something of $his life to help support them. The apathy to $his family's wishes is readily evident in $his tone of voice. $He begs you to make the necessary arrangements to enslave $him. $He's heard about you and how you like younger <<= $girl>>s, and that you take care of all the decision-making for your slaves. There's a lot of hope in $his tone, $he clearly wants an escape from responsibility — even if that means becoming a slave.

And this one is a rare one indeed. It's a personal file, and you suppress the urge to see whether $assistant.name is bugged and has misfiled an application for employment. The beautiful older $woman depicted has included a resume listing $his skills, and a clever selection of photographs: tasteful shots of $him in nice makeup and a fashionable business skirt, and fully nude mirror shots, flaws and all. Curious, you place a video call and get an immediate answer. It seems that 'personal circumstances' that $he saw coming are forcing $him to accept enslavement. $He had some weeks of warning, however, and seems to have made use of the time to find an arcology owner that treats $women of $his age well, and then to make $himself as appealing as possible in the hope you'll keep $him.

The call comes in from a middle-class area. It appears that the youthful man placing the call has a failing business, and is leveraging his last remaining asset by selling his stately-looking mother into slavery. Enslaving $him will be costlier than usual, but it seems likely to be worth it. From the dossier $his son forwarded to you, $he's both educated and intelligent, both relics of $his impressive pedigree. Even better, $he's aged like a fine wine, a short, stacked and attractive beauty with a face and rack that must be the envy of <<= $girl>>s half $his age. $He's aware of the situation at hand, and peeks in from the corner of the screen to say, "I hear you appre<<c>>iate a mature $woman; if I'm going down into <<s>>lavery, <<if $PC.title != 0>><<s>>ir<<else>>ma'am<</if>>, I hope for your <<s>>ake that you know how to treat a $woman of my caliber."

This one, unusually, is voice-only.

The mixed notes of despair, apathy, and fear in $his voice are heartrending, even to you. $He begs you to make the necessary arrangements to enslave $him. $He's heard about you and how you like petite <<= $girl>>s, and $he's also heard about brothels and arcades.

The person placing the call is physically quite unusual, to the point of looking distinctly unnatural, given that they are a dwarf sporting proportinally massive implants. $He crosses $his arms under $his bust and begins a rather haughty speal, given $his size. "Now don't go thinking of calling me a midget, thi<<s>> here i<<s>> one-hundred per<<c>>ent <<sh>>ort //and// <<s>>tacked, wouldn't you agree?" $He flexes back and grabs $his fat rear, $his blouse practically exploding in the process.

This one is interesting, even by the standards of messages from people who want to become slaves. The individual is neither sick nor abused, and speaks with directness.

The subject line of the latest is badly misspelled, but the accompanying profile image is impressive, if trite, depicting the sender's massive bicep flexing, veins playing across the striated muscle. Getting $his situation out of $him proves to be something of a chore, since $he scarcely has two functional neurons to rub together. It seems that $he's on a fair number of drugs, not limited to aphrodisiacs and steroids, that $he can't afford them, and that $he has a distorted image of $arcologies[0].name as a sort of muscle-worshipping Valhalla of sex and gains. Hearing $him describe $his idea of life as one of your slaves, you understand why this idiot wants to be enslaved. If $his idea of slave life were accurate, //you'd// want to be enslaved.

This one is a little odd; it merely begs you for an in person audience and offers you the sender's "unworthy body" as payment for granting it. You surreptitiously scan $him when $he arrives to make sure this isn't an attack of some kind, but $he's just a normal $girl wearing conservative clothing.

Ever since you have been steering $arcologies[0].name towards a belief in chattel religionism, you've been receiving increasingly useful communications from groups that share your ideals. With much of the old world in freefall, many groups with particularly vehement religious beliefs are expanding unchecked by the mores of big government, and by taking the chattel religionist side, you've automatically inserted yourself into a worldwide network of like-minded organizations. You receive a message from one such group.
<br><br>
It seems that the Chattel Religionists have all but taken over their town and driven out or converted the local worshippers of old world religions, save for a single religious building and its clergy who continue in defiance. This group has stepped in to put an end to this impiety. However, though they may be ruthless vigilantes, they don't consider themselves murderers. They're interested in fencing a member of the clergy to you, no questions asked, on a flat fee basis.

The call comes in from an old world university. The caller is a young $woman who explains that $he's struggling with extreme student debt, and has recently graduated with a history degree that $he can't seem to turn into gainful employment. $He gushes at length about how much $he enjoyed ancient history, and how $he's heard all about your ideas about reviving ancient culture in the Free Cities. $He sees joining your household as a romantic way out of $his difficult situation. Apparently $he read all the idyllic parts of history and somehow missed out on learning about the salt mines and slave galleys. $He's not terribly pretty and seems socially awkward, but that's likely to have its side benefits. $He nervously sends you a complete dossier on $himself.

Though the sacrifice and collaring of slaves is no secret, most people never find out the real truth to what you do.

You receive so many messages, as a noted titan of the new Free Cities world, that $assistant.name has to be quite draconian in culling them. _HeA lets only the most important through to you. One category of message that always gets through regardless of content, though, is requests for voluntary enslavement. As the new world takes shape, they've become less rare than they once were.
<br><br>
The call comes in from an office, and you suppress the urge to check whether $assistant.name has misidentified a business communication. The caller is a middle-aged $woman, not unattractive, whose face is lined with stress and worry. $He draws $himself up and says, "I would like to apply to be your <<s>>lave." There is a flash of bitter amusement at the absurd statement, but $he continues, "Bu<<s>>ine<<ss>> <<c>>ircum<<s>>tan<<c>>e<<s>> make it inevitable. I have con<<s>>iderable <<s>>kill<<s>> and e<<x>>perien<<c>>e, and it is my under<<s>>tanding that you value <<s>>uch thing<<s>>." $He forwards $his qualifications: they are comprehensive and open, including $his sexual skills as if they were merely another business asset. Which, in a way, they are.

		$He drags $himself in, but as the enslavement process winds grindingly on, $he shakes off $his depression. The vast weight of $his situation lifts from $him. You've seen this before, the perverse internal freedom that comes with the knowledge that $his life is in the hands of another now, and that all $he has to do or can do is obey. $His last words to you as a free $woman are an ironic statement that, when $he was teased back in school for the size of $his boobs, $he never thought they'd save $him one day.
	<<case "Pastoralist Two">>
		$He speaks to you as a free $woman while working through the enslavement process, perhaps $he hasn't quite grasped $his new role. Nonetheless, it seems as if a vast weight has been lifted from $his shoulders. You've seen this before, the perverse internal freedom that comes with the knowledge that $his life is in the hands of another now, and that all $he has to do or can do is obey. $His last words to you as a free $woman are an ironic statement that, people always praised $his milk filled udders as givers of life, yet $he never thought they'd save $hers one day.

		A battered VTOL craft arrives at $arcologies[0].name, broadcasting obviously bogus IFF codes. It seems this mercenary group is playing fast and loose in an attempt to get back on their feet. The aircraft doesn't even touch down on the pad they're directed to: it simply hovers <<if $showInches == 2>>six feet<<else>>two meters<</if>> off the pad for the five seconds it takes to shove a canvas bag that obviously contains a struggling human form out of the side door.
	<<case "Supremacist Two">>
		A clearly improvised VTOL craft arrives at $arcologies[0].name, broadcasting an erratic array of IFF codes. It seems this group hasn't quite mastered the intricacies of air travel.

	<<case "Subjugationist">>
		The enslavement process is disappointingly quiet, since $he's still unconscious. As of this morning $he was one of the last free $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace people in the arcology. Now $he's simply the newest sex slave of the inferior race to take $his proper place.

As of this morning $he was one of the last free $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace people in the arcology. Now $he's simply the newest, and perhaps most willing, sex slave of the inferior race to take $his proper place.
	<<case "Repopulation Efforts">>
		When $he arrives, $he comes directly to your to your penthouse for enslavement. $He wears an excited expression, having seen so many pregnant women on the way there, $he can barely contain $his enthusiasm. $He eagerly strips for inspection revealing $his moist pussy, it seems $he may be more into pregnancy then $he let on.
	<<case "Repopulation Efforts Two">>
		When $he arrives, $he is the very picture of someone who has seen the light at the end of a very dark tunnel. $He can't wait to get started making babies for you.
	<<case "Eugenics">>
		You interrupt $his rambling and bluntly inform $him that $he is useless to society. $He steps back, insulted, and attempts a rebuttal. You cut $him off again and tell $him $he's much more useful as your personal toy. $He takes another step back and is promptly restrained before being dragged off to the autosurgery.

Even if $he doesn't get to fulfill all $his desires, $his new life is more welcome than $his rapidly ending prior one. $He revealed as $he is escorted to the slave quarters that $he blew the last of $his money on $his visit here.
	<<case "Hedonistic Decadence Two">>
		When $he arrives, $he comes directly to your penthouse for enslavement. $He wears an expression of doubt, fear, and wonder as $he takes in the sights and sounds of the magnificent beast that is the new society taking shape in $arcologies[0].name. The enslavement process requires $him to be nude, of course, and it reveals $he has no idea how to be sexy. $He really is as boring as $he said $he was.
	<<case "Gender Radicalist">>
		When $he arrives, $he comes directly to your penthouse for enslavement. $He wears an expression of doubt, fear, and wonder as $he takes in the sights and sounds of the magnificent beast that is the new society taking shape in $arcologies[0].name. The enslavement process requires $him to be nude, of course, so $he doesn't need to strip to offer $himself to you when it's over. $He doesn't even have to be prompted: $he just gets down on the floor in front of your desk and offers you $his fuckhole.
	<<case "Gender Radicalist Two">>

	<<case "Gender Fundamentalist">>
		When $he arrives, $he is the very picture of a lost and very pregnant young waif. $He clearly feels some hope at leaving $his traditionalist home for a more modern society, but $he has just as clearly heard enough about the Free Cities to know that $he's likely to buy $his presence here through long years of sexual labor. $He sighs with relief at getting off $his feet when the enslavement process finally allows $him to sit.
	<<case "Gender Fundamentalist Two">>
		When $he arrives, $he is the very picture of a distraught and very pregnant mature $woman. $He clearly feels some resentment at $his traditionalist home and family for selling $him into slavery, but $he has just as clearly heard enough about the Free Cities to know that $he's likely traded one form of marginalization for another.
	<<case "Paternalist">>
		$He speaks to you as a free $woman throughout the enslavement process, but as soon as it is completed, $he stops and waits for instruction before talking. $He does not look directly at your face, but keeps $his gaze lower than that, and stands expectant and ready for commands. You are reminded of $his intelligence by $his precisely correct behavior for a new slave, even before you give any kind of direction.
	<<case "Paternalist Two">>
		$He speaks to you as a free $woman throughout the enslavement process, but as soon as it is completed, $he stops and waits for instruction before talking. $He may not have had many prospects in $his life back home, but if $he remains this obedient $he'll fit right in here in the Free Cities.
	<<case "Degradationist">>
		When $he arrives as part of the anonymous slave transfers that make up a good part of the inter-arcology commerce, $he has clearly had some time to mull over $his situation. As soon as $he sees you, $he blurts out, "Whatever that fucker told you, it i<<s>>n't true. I'll be your little bitch bimbo, whatever you want. Ju<<s>>t don't — ju<<s>>t don't fucking hurt me." $He sticks out $his chest in a clear attempt to entice you with $his fake tits.
	<<case "Degradationist Two">>
		When $he arrives as part of the anonymous slave transfers that make up a good part of the inter-arcology commerce, $he has clearly had some time to mull over $his situation. As soon as $he sees you, $he glares deep into your eyes and addresses you directly, "Tho<<s>>e fucker<<s>> threw everything they could at me; you can't break me. No one can."
	<<case "Intellectual Dependency">>
		When $he arrives, $he is lead directly to your penthouse for enslavement. $He wears an expression of avid wonder as $he takes in the sights and sounds of the magnificent beast that is the new society taking shape in $arcologies[0].name. The enslavement process requires $him to be nude which, of course, goes about as well as $his mother alluded to. By the time you get $him undressed, $he's passed out on your floor with $his bare ass up in the air. After getting a taste for sex, and an obedience lesson, $he'll fit right in.
	<<case "Intellectual Dependency Two">>
		<<set $activeSlave.intelligence = _geneticInt>>
		It takes several hours to track $him down for enslavement and once $he arrives it becomes clear that $his mental state has broken down even further. $He spends the better part of the process masturbating and begging for you to touch $his body.
	<<case "Slave Professionalism">>
		When $he arrives, $he gracefully enters while stripping down to $his birthday suit in an erotic display of $his talents. It's clear $he feels some relief in your gaze, but $he knows enough about the Free Cities to know that $he's likely going to be continuing $his career in sexual labor. Only this time, $he'll be more appreciated for $his talents rather than $his body.
	<<case "Slave Professionalism Two">>
		From the first moment you see $him, $he is acting the part of an ideal slave. Re-enslaving $him is a near effortless affair. As much as $he tries to politely conceal it, you can feel the joy radiating off of $him.
	<<case "Body Purist">>
		When $he arrives, it's obvious that $he isn't particularly happy with the situation, but there is some evident relief to $him. When asked about it, $he says, "I really hate the idea of surgery, especially implant surgery, <<= WrittenMaster($activeSlave)>>. Just — the idea of having fake shit in here —" $he rubs $his chest a little "— Ugh." $He laughs bitterly at $himself, and then rubs $his chest again, looking at you with mixed fear and invitation.
	<<case "Body Purist Two">>
		When $he arrives, it's obvious that $he's fairly happy. After all, the slave school trained $him for this. When asked about it, $he says, "<<S>>ome of the $girl<<s>> who graduated before me were given implant<<s>>, <<Master>>. Just — the idea of having fake <<sh>>it in here —" $he rubs $his chest a little "— ugh. I'm glad you're not into that" $He laughs bitterly at $himself, and then rubs $his chest again, looking at you with mixed fear and invitation.
	<<case "Transformation Fetishist">>
		$He arrives with various medical devices still attached to $him, wrapped up in supportive hospital clothing. Despite this, it's obvious that you've made a good decision. The new tits that got $him into this situation are so cartoonish that some of the medical tubing has been hastily routed between them. After a few weeks on curatives and a few more in training, $he'll be ready to bounce those fake boobs up and down as $he takes dick.
	<<case "Transformation Fetishist Two">>
		$He arrives unapologetically in $his fine clothing. "I'm not <<s>>orry," $he says harshly, "but I'm wearing my best one last time whether you like it or not." Eventually $he sighs, squares $his shoulders, and visibly steels $himself. "I'll <<s>>ay <<a>>s a free $woman, <<s>>in<<c>>e it'<<s>> my la<<s>>t chan<<c>>e to <<s>>ay anything a<<s>> a free $woman, you're good-looking, for an evil slaveholding oligarch." $He delivers this last with a little smile on $his plush lips and a sense of bitter irony in $his voice. "If we'd met at a ni<<c>>e party la<<s>>t week I might have made a pa<<ss>> at you. You'd be a better choi<<c>>e than my e<<x>>-hu<<s>>band at lea<<s>>t."
	<<case "Slimness Enthusiast">>
		$He arrives apologizing for $his fine clothing. "I'm sorry," $he apologizes sadly, "but I wanted to wear my best one last time." $He sighs, squares $his shoulders, and visibly steels $himself. "I'll say as a free $woman, since it's my la<<s>>t chance to <<s>>ay anything a<<s>> a free $woman, you're good-looking, for an evil <<s>>laveholding oligarch." $He delivers this last with a little smile on $his lips and rich turn of humor in $his voice. "If we'd met at a ni<<c>>e party la<<s>>t week I might have made a pa<<ss>> at you. I <<s>>uppo<<s>>e that'<<s>> be<<s>>ide the point now."
	<<case "Slimness Enthusiast Two">>
		When $he arrives, $he is the very picture of a young waif out of $his depth. It's clear $he feels relief and escaping going under the knife, but $he knows enough about the Free Cities to know that $he's likely to buy $his presence here through long years of sexual labor.
	<<case "Asset Expansionist">>
		When $he arrives, it's clear $he's nobody's fool. $He comes without personal effects of any kind, and is wearing cheap, sturdy clothes to travel in, since $he knows $he'll be taking them off immediately. $He does, without being told, just as soon as the enslavement formalities are out of the way. $His breasts are capped by titanic, puffy nipples; $he notices you appreciating them and gives you a hesitant little smile, swaying $his shoulders back and forth a little to set $his flesh deliciously into motion.
	<<case "Asset Expansionist Two">>
		When $he arrives, it's clear $he's nobody's fool. $He comes without personal effects of any kind, and is wearing cheap, sturdy clothes to travel in, since $he knows $he'll be taking them off immediately. $He does, without being told, just as soon as the enslavement formalities are out of the way. $His breasts are capped by titanic, puffy nipples; $he notices you appreciating them and gives you a hesitant little smile, swaying $his shoulders back and forth a little to set $his flesh deliciously into motion.
	<<case "Physical Idealist">>
		$He gets through the enslavement process without breaking anything, mostly due to your increasingly exasperated supervision. You wondered whether the destruction of $his moronic ideas about life as one of your slaves was going to cause an explosion, but it seems that $he's under fewer illusions than you thought. $He's obviously familiar with getting fucked as a way of earning $his keep, and hangs around, flexing idly and clearly wondering when you'll get on with it.
	<<case "Physical Idealist Two">>
		When $he arrives, you're impressed again. $He's even more muscular in person than in $his pictures. "<<Master>>," $he growls, "I've done my very be<<s>>t to be the bigge<<s>>t, <<s>>tronge<<s>>t <<s>>lave before coming here. May I <<sh>>ow you?" More than a little curious, you nod. $He reaches down to place a palm on the ground. "Well, <<Master>>, I had a month. <<S>>o I did my be<<s>>t to get in <<sh>>ape." $He suddenly flips as if starting a cartwheel, but stops suspended in midair, holding $his entire muscular frame off the ground with just one hand planted on the floor. $He turns slowly, revealing the base of an impressively large buttplug nestling between $his cheeks. $He knows $his audience.
	<<case "Youth Preferentialist">>
		Your slaving network gets $him out of $his difficult situation without trouble, forwarding $him the necessary travel documents. When $he arrives, $he displays the clear signs of someone who has learned to avoid abuse: $he takes no initiative and does nothing without instructions, just standing dumbly until ordered; when told what to do, $he does it quickly and carefully. Though $his mind is not broken, there is something dead lurking in $his eyes. When $he looks at you, it is with the watchful caution of an abused animal.
	<<case "Youth Preferentialist Two">>
		Your slaving network extracts $him from $his family's grasp easily, forwarding $him the necessary travel documents. When $he arrives, $he displays the clear signs of someone who's never had to think for themselves: $he takes no initiative and does nothing without instructions, just standing dumbly until ordered; when told what to do, $he does it quickly and carefully. Though $his mind is not broken, there's clearly not a lot in there. Being a slave may actually be $his most fitting vocation.
	<<case "Maturity Preferentialist">>
		When $he arrives, you're impressed again. $He elected to appear in black lace lingerie, and stalks into your office on high heels with a calculated sensuality. "<<Master>>," $he purrs, "I've done my very be<<s>>t to get ready to be a good <<s>>lave. May I <<sh>>ow you?" More than a little curious, you nod. $He starts to strip slowly and skillfully. "Well, <<Master>>, I had a month. <<S>>o I did my be<<s>>t to get in <<sh>>ape." $He rubs $his hands down $his toned belly, hooking fingers under $his thong. "I practi<<c>>ed <<s>>tripping. I practi<<c>>ed blowjob<<s>>." $He turns slowly, revealing the base of an impressively large buttplug nestling between $his cheeks. "I even practi<<c>>ed butt<<s>>e<<x>>."
	<<case "Maturity Preferentialist Two">>
		$He arrives apologizing for $his fine clothing. "I'm <<s>>orry," $he apologizes sadly, "but I wanted to wear my be<<s>>t one la<<s>>t time." $He sighs, squares $his shoulders, and visibly steels $himself. "My <<s>>on'<<s>> a ba<<s>>tard for <<s>>elling me to you, and all to <<s>>ave that u<<s>>ele<<ss>> <<s>>tore of hi<<s>>." $He delivers this last with a bitter smile on $his lips. "At lea<<s>>t he had the <<s>>en<<s>>e to <<s>>ell me to <<s>>omeone with e<<x>>qui<<s>>ite ta<<s>>te, like you. After all, you did buy me."
	<<case "Petite Admiration">>
		Your slaving network gets $him out of $his difficult situation without trouble, forwarding $him the necessary travel documents. When $he arrives, $he displays the clear signs of someone who has learned to avoid attention: $he takes no initiative and does nothing without instructions, just standing dumbly until ordered; when told what to do, $he does it quickly and carefully. When $he looks at you, it is with the watchful caution of a hunted animal.
	<<case "Petite Admiration Two">>
		$He arrives unapologetically in $his fine clothing. "I'm not <<s>>orry," $he says coyly, "but thi<<s>> outfit highlight<<s>> my good<<s>>." Eventually $he sighs and sets to work popping $his assets out of the straining dress. "<<S>>o, what <<sh>>all we do fir<<s>>t? I'm <<s>>ure I know <<s>>ome thing<<s>> that could make even you blu<<sh>>, hottie."
	<<case "Statuesque Glorification">>
		When $he arrives, $he is the very picture of someone out of $his depth. It's clear $he feels some relief over not being at the mercy of the slavers, but $he knows enough about the Free Cities to know that $he's likely to buy $his presence here through long years of sexual labor.
	<<case "Statuesque Glorification Two">>
		When $he arrives, $he is the very picture of someone in over $his head. The only thing separating $him from ridicule is a pair of high heels; a fact $he is very aware of as $he struggles with doubts through the enslavement process.
	<<case "Chattel Religionist">>
		$He lets out a convulsive sob when you accept $his servitude, and is painfully obsequious as you complete the formalities of enslavement. Your exam reveals several minor indications of self-harm — chewed nails, bitten lips, and such. But for all that, a remarkable look of peace has settled on the poor woman's face. $He waits patiently for a hint of your will, <<if canAchieveErection($activeSlave)>>$his cock painfully erect<<elseif $activeSlave.dick > 0>>precum dripping from $his soft dick<<else>>$his pussy visibly moist<</if>> at the prospect of the servile sex $he is convinced is $his duty.
	<<case "Chattel Religionist Two">>
		You complete the legalities and a clearly improvised VTOL craft arrives at $arcologies[0].name, broadcasting an erratic array of IFF codes. It seems this group hasn't quite mastered the intricacies of air travel. The aircraft doesn't seem capable of the delicate feat of landing on the pad it had been directed to: it simply hovers <<if $showInches == 2>>six feet<<else>>two meters<</if>> off the pad for the five seconds it takes to shove a canvas bag that obviously contains a struggling human form out of the side door. The condemned prays tirelessly throughout the biometric scanning process, utterly shocked and disgusted by what they've witnessed in just the few minutes they've been in your arcology. Then it's off to the penthouse for basic slave induction.
	<<case "Roman Revivalist">>
		$He arrives wide-eyed and enthusiastic about the historical style $he <<if canSee($activeSlave)>>saw<<elseif canHear($activeSlave)>>heard<<else>>felt<</if>> on the way in. $He swallows nervously throughout the enslavement process and even cries a little at the end. $He's slow to undress, and when $he's finished, $he covers $his modest breasts with one arm and $his mons with the other. It seems that $he's about to have a rude awakening about the realities of being a house slave.
	<<case "Aztec Revivalist">>
		$He arrives awestruck by <<if canSee($activeSlave)>>all the sights<<else>>everything<</if>> $he passed through to get to your abode. $He probably didn't see anything too extreme, but $he will soon. Feeling your gaze on $his body, $he quickly abandons all fears from $his past life, strips off $his clothes, and submits to you fully. Only time will tell if $he made a mistake.
	<<case "Edo Revivalist">>
		$He arrives with doubt already clouding $his eyes. It seems $he passed one of the arcology's seedier bars on $his way up to your penthouse; the sight of roaring patrons swilling cheap sake and manhandling whores in loose kimonos does not seem to have been part of $his expectations. As the enslavement process winds on, $he reflexively begins to look around for a means of escape, and slowly collapses into $himself as $he realizes there is none.
	<<case "Arabian Revivalist">>
		Your estimation of $him rises through the enslavement process: $he doffs and discards $his conservative business wear without complaint, and stands nude before you, obeying instructions without fuss. There is an indecipherable glint in $his <<print App.Desc.eyesColor($activeSlave)>>: nerves? Excitement? Challenge, even? Perhaps $he even feels this is an adventure. And that, it will certainly be.
	<<case "Chinese Revivalist">>
		$He arrives in a simple, sturdy suit, which $he obviously wore in the correct anticipation of immediately removing and never seeing again. $He cooperates with the enslavement process as best $he can, $his glance confident and watchful. $He's obviously calculating how to get ahead within this new place, and $he pays particularly close attention as the ebb and flow of business through your office brings your various slaves into $his view for the first time.

		The purchasing agent is businesslike, even hurried. The inert slave receives a simple check, with some industrious fingering of orifices, and is bundled off. As is appropriate.
	<<case "Subjugationist Two">>
		The enslavement process is disappointingly quiet, since $he does little more than stare blankly ahead and respond to any orders. As of this morning $he was one of the last free $arcologies[0].FSSubjugationistRace people in the arcology. Now $he's simply the newest, and perhaps most willing, sex slave of the inferior race to take $his proper place. $He's taken away by a purchasing agent soon after.
	<<case "Repopulation Efforts">>
		When $he arrives, $he comes directly to your to your penthouse for enslavement. $He wears an excited expression, having seen so many pregnant women on the way there, $he can barely contain $his enthusiasm. $He eagerly strips for inspection revealing $his moist pussy, it seems $he may be more into pregnancy then $he let on. You shake your head to $him as a purchaser's agent appears to take $him away. $He asks if $he'll still be impregnated and the agent nods approvingly. $He seems slightly downtrodden that $he won't be yours but $he accepts the fact that $he'll still be useful to your future.
	<<case "Repopulation Efforts Two">>
		When $he arrives, $he is the very picture of a someone who has seen the light at the end of a very dark tunnel. $He can't wait to get started making babies for you. A purchaser's agent arrives to take charge of $him and $he pleads not to leave $him infertile. You abate $his fears, $his fertility will be restored. $His new owner likes to experiment with fertility agents; $he'll quickly be pregnant with <<if $seeHyperPreg == 1>>dozens of children<<else>>multiples<</if>>. $His face alights at the thought. $He'll finally have all the children $he'd dreamed of.

You cut $him off and inform $him that $his current belly pales in comparison to $his new owner's previous champion. $He should expect to be tied up and force-fed until $his entire body is filled to capacity with slave food. $He gulps nervously as $he escorted out by the portly purchasing agent to $his new home.
	<<case "Hedonistic Decadence Two">>
		When $he arrives, $he comes directly to your penthouse for enslavement. $He wears an expression of doubt, fear, and wonder as $he takes in the sights and sounds of the magnificent beast that is the new society taking shape in $arcologies[0].name. A purchaser's agent arrives to take charge of $him, and $he asks politely who bought $him. A man with an oviposition fetish, you tell $him. $He fails to grasp the meaning. You explain to $him that eggs will be stuck into all $his holes until $he can't stomach any more. $He turns beat red at the description, so you carry on. $His new owner will likely remodel $his cervix to allow eggs to be pumped straight into $his womb; $he'll be lucky if $he can stand once he's done with $him. Then $he'll have to look forward to laying them all for his amusement. $His hands have since moved to $his crotch, it seems $he's getting into the fantasy.
	<<case "Gender Radicalist">>
		When $he arrives, $he comes directly to your penthouse for enslavement. $He wears an expression of doubt, fear, and wonder as $he takes in the sights and sounds of the magnificent beast that is the new society taking shape in $arcologies[0].name. A purchaser's agent arrives to take charge of $him, and $he asks politely who bought $him. A salon, you tell $him; $he'll be trained to $he tables, serve drinks, and entertain customers with $his mouth and anus.
	<<case "Gender Radicalist Two">>
		When $he arrives, $he comes directly to your penthouse for enslavement. $He wears an expression of doubt, fear, and wonder as $he takes in the sights and sounds of the magnificent beast that is the new society taking shape in $arcologies[0].name. A purchaser's agent arrives to take charge of $him, and $he asks politely who bought $him. A salon, you tell $him; $he'll be trained to wait tables, serve drinks, and entertain customers with $his mouth and anus.
	<<case "Gender Fundamentalist">>
		When $he arrives, $he is the very picture of a lost and very pregnant young waif. $He clearly feels some hope at leaving $his traditionalist home for a more modern society, but $he has just as clearly heard enough about the Free Cities to know that $he's likely to buy $his presence here through long years of sexual labor. A purchaser's agent appears to take $him away, and $he quietly asks who's bought $him. A breeder, you tell $him, who prefers stock proven to be fertile. $He'll probably manage 20 pregnancies or so, before $he's retired.
	<<case "Gender Fundamentalist Two">>
		When $he arrives, $he is the very picture of a distraught and very pregnant mature $woman. $He clearly feels some resentment at $his traditionalist home and family for selling $him into slavery, but $he has just as clearly heard enough about the Free Cities to know that $he's likely traded one form of marginalization for another. A purchaser's agent appears to take $him away, and $he quietly asks who's bought $him. A breeder, you tell $him, who prefers to squeeze a few pregnancies out of mature women. $He'll probably manage a few pregnancies before $he's retired.
	<<case "Paternalist">>
		$He speaks to you as a free $woman throughout the enslavement process, but as soon as it is completed, $he stops and waits for instruction before talking. $He does not look directly at your face, but keeps $his gaze lower than that, and stands expectant and ready for commands. You are reminded of $his intelligence by $his presence of mind when a purchaser's agent arrives to take charge of $him; $he clearly calculates that making a scene will gain $him nothing, and cooperates. You reward this by telling $him the truth: $he's been sold to a citizen of $arcologies[0].name who shares paternalistic beliefs; $he'll be fine.
	<<case "Paternalist Two">>
		$He speaks to you as a free $woman throughout the enslavement process, but as soon as it is completed, $he stops and waits for instruction before talking. $He may not have had many prospects in $his life back home, but if $he remains this obedient $he'll fit right in here in the Free Cities. When the purchasing agent arrives $he is momentarily surprised but not alarmed, $he figures $he'll been sold to a citizen of $arcologies[0].name who shares paternalistic beliefs.
	<<case "Degradationist">>
		When $he arrives as part of the anonymous slave transfers that make up a good part of the inter-arcology commerce, $he has clearly had some time to mull over $his situation. As soon as $he sees you, $he blurts out, "Whatever that fucker told you, it i<<s>>n't true. I'll be your little bitch bimbo, whatever you want. Ju<<s>>t don't — ju<<s>>t don't fucking hurt me." $He sticks out $his chest in a clear attempt to entice you with $his fake tits, and is rewarded with a bag over $his head, courtesy of the purchaser's agent who arrived in the meantime. The agent clearly felt that $he would be a handful worth corralling quickly, and this proves correct. $He goes limp after being tased, though.
	<<case "Degradationist Two">>
		When $he arrives as part of the anonymous slave transfers that make up a good part of the inter-arcology commerce, $he has clearly had some time to mull over $his situation. As soon as $he sees you, $he glares deep into your eyes and addresses you directly, "Tho<<s>>e fucker<<s>> threw everything they could at me, you can't break me. No one can." $He is rewarded with a bag over $his head, courtesy of the purchaser's agent who arrived in the meantime. The agent clearly felt that $he would be a handful worth corralling quickly, and this proves correct. $He goes limp after being tased, though.
	<<case "Intellectual Dependency">>
		When $he arrives, $he is lead directly to your penthouse for enslavement. $He wears an expression of avid wonder as $he takes in the sights and sounds of the magnificent beast that is the new society taking shape in $arcologies[0].name. The purchaser's agent's bag slipping over $his head, however, sours $his mood. Mustering all of $his strength, $he breaks into a run, collides with the now closed door, and collapses into a heap, leaving the swearing agent to carry $him off.
	<<case "Intellectual Dependency Two">>
		It takes several hours to track $him down for enslavement and once $he arrives it becomes clear that $his mental state has broken down even further. A purchaser's agent arrives and takes charge of $him, and takes hold of $his hand. He leads $him away, and it's done.
	<<case "Slave Professionalism">>
		When $he arrives, $he gracefully enters and starts to strip before you can stop $him. A growing look of concern spreads across $his face when a purchaser's agent arrives to take $him away. $He looks at you desperately, begging to know who's purchased $him. You let $him know $he still has a fan here and they weren't about to let this chance slip by. $He seems elated by this.
	<<case "Slave Professionalism Two">>
		From the first moment you see $him, $he is acting the part of an ideal slave. Even when a purchaser's agent arrives to take $him away, you can still feel a sense of joy radiating from $him.
	<<case "Body Purist">>
		When $he arrives, it's obvious that $he isn't particularly happy with the situation, but there is some evident relief to $him. It vanishes when a purchaser's agent arrives to take $him away. $He looks at you desperately, begging to know who's purchased $him. You tell $him truthfully that a wealthy citizen one arcology over bought $him as a house slave; you neglect to mention that he likes big tits, and he isn't particular about whether they're natural.
	<<case "Body Purist Two">>
		When $he arrives, it's obvious that $he's fairly happy. After all, the slave school trained $him for this. When asked about it, $he says, "<<S>>ome of the $girl<<s>> who graduated before me were given implant<<s>>, <<Master>>. Just — the idea of having fake <<sh>>it in here —" $he rubs $his chest a little "— Ugh. I'm glad you're not into that" $He laughs bitterly at $himself, and then rubs $his chest again, looking at you with mixed fear and invitation. $His playfulness vanishes when a purchaser's agent arrives to take $him away. $He looks at you desperately, begging to know who's purchased $him. You tell $him truthfully that a wealthy citizen one arcology over bought $him as a house slave; you neglect to mention that he likes big tits, and he isn't particular about whether they're natural.
	<<case "Transformation Fetishist">>
		The only downside to $his condition is that reselling $him is utterly anticlimactic. A purchaser's agent arrives and takes charge of $him, transferring $him to a medical transport bed. He takes $him away, and it's done.
	<<case "Transformation Fetishist Two">>
		$He arrives unapologetically in $his fine clothing. "I'm not <<s>>orry," $he says harshly, "but I'm wearing my be<<s>>t one la<<s>>t time whether you like it or not." Eventually $he sighs, squares $his shoulders, and visibly steels $himself. $He's about to declaim something when a purchaser's agent arrives to bundle $him off. $His face darkens and $he mulls something over, probably preparing a really cutting remark, but before $he can deliver it the agent fastens a bag over $his head and $he is heard no more.
	<<case "Slimness Enthusiast">>
		$He arrives apologizing for $his fine clothing. "I'm <<s>>orry," $he apologizes sadly, "but I wanted to wear my be<<s>>t one la<<s>>t time." $He sighs, squares $his shoulders, and visibly steels $himself. $He's about to declaim something when a purchaser's agent arrives to bundle $him off. $His face darkens and $he mulls something over, probably preparing a really cutting remark, but before $he can deliver it the agent fastens a bag over $his head and $he is heard no more.
	<<case "Slimness Enthusiast Two">>
		When $he arrives, $he is the very picture of a young waif out of $his depth. It's clear $he feels relief and escaping going under the knife, but $he knows enough about the Free Cities to know that $he's likely to buy $his presence here through long years of sexual labor. A purchaser's agent appears to take $him away, and $he quietly asks who's bought $him. A citizen, you tell $him, who prefers his $women slender and unimplanted. $He seems relieved by this.
	<<case "Asset Expansionist">>
		When $he arrives, it's clear $he's nobody's fool. $He comes without personal effects of any kind, and is wearing cheap, sturdy clothes to travel in, since $he knows $he'll be taking them off immediately. $He does, without being told, just as soon as the enslavement formalities are out of the way. $His breasts are capped by titanic, puffy nipples; $he notices you appreciating them and gives you a hesitant little smile, swaying $his shoulders back and forth a little to set $his flesh deliciously into motion. $His playfulness vanishes when a purchaser's agent arrives to take $him away. $He looks at you desperately, begging to know who's purchased $him. You tell $him truthfully that a wealthy citizen one arcology over bought $him as a house slave; you neglect to mention that he likes big tits.
	<<case "Asset Expansionist Two">>
		When $he arrives, it's clear $he's nobody's fool. $He comes without personal effects of any kind, and is wearing cheap, sturdy clothes to travel in, since $he knows $he'll be taking them off immediately. $He does, without being told, just as soon as the enslavement formalities are out of the way. $His breasts are capped by titanic, puffy nipples; $he notices you appreciating them and gives you a hesitant little smile, swaying $his shoulders back and forth a little to set $his flesh deliciously into motion. $His playfulness vanishes when a purchaser's agent arrives to take $him away. $He looks at you desperately, begging to know who's purchased $him. You tell $him truthfully that a wealthy citizen one arcology over bought $him as a house slave; you neglect to mention that he likes big tits.
	<<case "Physical Idealist">>
		$He gets through the enslavement process without breaking anything, mostly due to your increasingly exasperated supervision. $His buyer's agent arrives to take $him away, and it takes the poor man ten minutes to get the situation through $his thick skull. He sees the beginnings of rage building in $him as $he realizes how $he's been tricked, but he's a quick draw, and before $he can do anything he's got his taser unholstered and deployed. The bitch gives off an antediluvian roar as $he goes stiff as a board and crashes to the floor.
	<<case "Physical Idealist Two">>
		When $he arrives, you're impressed again. $He's even more muscular in person than in $his pictures. "<<Master>>," $he growls, "I've done my very be<<s>>t to be the bigge<<s>>t, <<s>>tronge<<s>>t <<s>>lave before coming here. May I <<sh>>ow you?" Though more than a little curious, the arrival of the purchasing agent cuts short any theatrics. Though initially confused, the promise of steroids and other drugs by $his new owner has $him follow the agent out of your penthouse without fuss.
	<<case "Youth Preferentialist">>
		Your slaving network gets $him out of $his difficult situation without trouble, forwarding $him the necessary travel documents. When $he arrives, $he displays the clear signs of someone who has learned to avoid abuse: $he takes no initiative and does nothing without instructions, just standing dumbly until ordered; when told what to do, $he does it quickly and carefully. When a buyer's agent arrives to take $him away, $he follows him without a backward glance.
	<<case "Youth Preferentialist Two">>
		Your slaving network extracts $him from $his family's grasp easily, forwarding $him the necessary travel documents. When $he arrives, $he displays the clear signs of someone who's never had to think for themselves: $he takes no initiative and does nothing without instructions, just standing dumbly until ordered; when told what to do, $he does it quickly and carefully. Though $his mind is not broken, there's clearly not a lot in there. Being a slave may actually be $his most fitting vocation. When a buyer's agent arrives to take $him away, $he follows him without a backward glance, clearly unaware of who he is.
	<<case "Maturity Preferentialist">>
		$He and the buyer's agent arrive at the same time. $He accepts this defeat with good grace, and cooperates with him as best $he can. $He gives you a single questioning glance, with just a glint of hope; you take pity, and tell $him $he won't be going far. $He's to be employed in one of the arcology's better MILF brothels. $He'll be fucked ten times tomorrow, it's true, but $he'll be well treated when $he doesn't have dicks in $him.
	<<case "Maturity Preferentialist Two">>
		$He arrives apologizing for $his fine clothing. "I'm <<s>>orry," $he apologizes sadly, "but I wanted to wear my be<<s>>t one la<<s>>t time." $He sighs, squares $his shoulders, and visibly steels $himself. "My <<s>>on'<<s>> a ba<<s>>tard for <<s>>elling me to you, and all to <<s>>ave that u<<s>>ele<<ss>> <<s>>tore of hi<<s>>." $He delivers this last with a bitter smile on $his lips. "At lea<<s>>t he had the <<s>>en<<s>>e to <<s>>ell me to <<s>>omeone with e<<x>>qui<<s>>ite ta<<s>>te, like you. After all, you did buy me." $He's about to declaim something else when a purchaser's agent arrives to bundle $him off. $His face darkens and $he mulls something over, probably preparing a really cutting remark, but before $he can deliver it the agent fastens a bag over $his head and $he is heard no more.
	<<case "Petite Admiration">>
		Your slaving network gets $him out of $his difficult situation without trouble, forwarding $him the necessary travel documents. When $he arrives, $he displays the clear signs of someone who has learned to avoid attention: $he takes no initiative and does nothing without instructions, just standing dumbly until ordered; when told what to do, $he does it quickly and carefully. When a buyer's agent arrives to take $him away, a look of terror flashes across $his face. You tell $him truthfully that a wealthy citizen bought $him as a bed slave; you neglect to mention the competition they encourage amongst their harem. A meek girl like $him will likely be the lowest in the pecking order.
	<<case "Petite Admiration Two">>
		$He arrives unapologetically in $his fine clothing. "I'm not <<s>>orry," $he says coyly, "but thi<<s>> outfit highlight<<s>> my good<<s>>." Eventually $he sighs and sets to work popping $his assets out of the straining dress. "<<S>>o, what <<sh>>all we do fir<<s>>t? I'm <<s>>ure I know <<s>>ome thing<<s>> that could make even you blu<<sh>>, hottie." As the purchaser's agent appears to take $him away, $he scoffs and demands to know who's bought $him. A breeder, you tell $him, who plans to breed to perfect race of servile dwarves. "Oh hell no! Do you have any idea how much I <<s>>pent perfecting my body!? You think I'm ju<<s>>t going to let <<s>>ome fuck ruin it with kid<<s>>?! You can go fuck-" Into a bag and over the agent's shoulder $he goes, never to be seen again.
	<<case "Statuesque Glorification">>
		When $he arrives, $he is the very picture of someone out of $his depth. It's clear $he feels some relief over not being at the mercy of the slavers, but $he knows enough about the Free Cities to know that $he's likely to buy $his presence here through long years of sexual labor. A purchaser's agent appears to take $him away, and $he quietly asks who's bought $him. A breeder, you tell $him, who plans to breed the ideal line of giants.
		<<if $activeSlave.dick > 0>>
			$He'll be the center of $his own little harem for as long as $he can keep them swollen with children.
		<<else>>
			$He'll probably manage 20 pregnancies or so before $he's retired, but during that time $he'll be pampered, if not a little sore.
		<</if>>
	<<case "Statuesque Glorification Two">>
		When $he arrives, $he comes directly to your penthouse for enslavement. $He wears an expression of doubt, fear, and wonder as $he takes in the sights and sounds of the magnificent beast that is the new society taking shape in $arcologies[0].name. A purchaser's agent arrives to take charge of $him, and $he asks politely who bought $him. A man with a means to fix $his height issue, you tell $him. $He should be able to walk again within a year, assuming the surgery is a success. $He shudders at the concept and steels $himself; not everyone has access to the high end technology you do after all.
	<<case "Chattel Religionist">>
		$He lets out a convulsive sob when you accept $his servitude, and is painfully obsequious as you complete the formalities of enslavement. When $his buyer arrives to take $him away, the realization agonizes $him, but $he snuffs out $his saddened reaction almost as soon as it dawns on $his face. $He visibly draws $himself up, obviously telling $himself that service under one master is as righteous as service under another.
	<<case "Chattel Religionist Two">>
		You complete the legalities and a clearly improvised VTOL craft arrives at $arcologies[0].name, broadcasting an erratic array of IFF codes. It seems this group hasn't quite mastered the intricacies of air travel. The aircraft doesn't seem capable of the delicate feat of landing on the pad it had been directed to: it simply hovers <<if $showInches == 2>>six feet<<else>>two meters<</if>> off the pad for the five seconds it takes to shove a canvas bag that obviously contains a struggling human form out of the side door. The condemned prays tirelessly they're unpacked, utterly shocked and disgusted by what they've witnessed in just the few minutes they've been in your arcology. You tell them to cheer up — they're off to a nice little brothel where they'll learn the joys of their new religion. You make out a single word as they are hauled away, "Bla<<s>>phemer!" Seems someone wants you to patron them in their new career.
	<<case "Roman Revivalist">>
		$He arrives with doubt already clouding $his eyes. It seems $he got an introduction to the reality of Roman Revivalism on $his way up the arcology to your villa. The violence it did to $his vision of Rome is deeply ironic; $arcologies[0].name is a fair reproduction of the decadence and vigor of imperial Rome. If $he's shocked by the screams of a slave dying in gladiatorial combat or the spectacle of prisoners from the provinces being sold at auction, that's $his ignorance. When you cause a price placard to be affixed to $his chest so $he can be sold at auction, the reality of $his future finally comes home to $him.
	<<case "Aztec Revivalist">>
		$He arrives so terrified, $he can't stop shaking and won't acknowledge most of your commands. It seems $he realized what really goes on in this arcology. The blood and gruesome mutilation is very far from $he envisioned for $his future; $arcologies[0].name is a close reproduction of the miasma of death that accompanied the Aztecs. $He's currently too shaken to realize what awaits $him. Whether good or bad, $he can't back out. $He's yours.
	<<case "Edo Revivalist">>
		$He arrives with doubt already clouding $his eyes. It seems $he passed one of the arcology's seedier bars on $his way up to your penthouse; the sight of roaring patrons swilling cheap sake and manhandling whores in loose kimonos does not seem to have been part of $his expectations. When a buyer's agent arrives to take charge of $his low-value body, $he manages to spit out a last bit of bad Japanese (a childish insult) before he bags $him. The body in the bag struggles spastically until he knuckles it hard in the kidney, slings it over his shoulder, and carries the package out, grinning at you in commiseration.
	<<case "Arabian Revivalist">>
		$He arrives and works $his way through the enslavement process without fuss. When a buyer's agent arrives, $he immediately understands that $he has been sold. $He looks rueful for a moment, obviously realizing that you made no commitment not to do this, and that such a commitment would have been worthless in any case. $He flawlessly performs the only successful insult available to $him, ignoring you utterly from that moment on, but obeying the agent faultlessly.
	<<case "Chinese Revivalist">>
		$He arrives and works $his way through the enslavement process, doing $his best to ingratiate $himself. When a buyer's agent arrives, $he immediately understands that $he has been sold. $He looks rueful for a moment, obviously realizing that you made no commitment not to do this, and that such a commitment would have been worthless in any case. $He transfers $his focus to the agent without hesitation, doing $his best to improve $his rapidly changing position.
