<<= App.UI.slaveDescriptionDialog($activeSlave)>> is an incredible mother. $He's given birth to numbers that would have been considered absurd in the days when drug treatments were limited by consent. A nascent organization will be holding a pageant for pregnant slaves tomorrow, and since they're aware you keep breeders, they've sent you an invitation to enter a heavily pregnant slave to be judged.

<br><br>

This is a rare opportunity. The idea of a pregnancy pageant isn't new but it is undeniably going to attract attention, so the pageant is likely to draw some serious press. Were $activeSlave.slaveName to win, $he would probably be remembered for a long time as a special mother.

It's likely there was some bribery behind the scenes, and it is fatal to $his chances of winning. Though $his pregnant body is the most impressive on display, another slaveowner who was more open-handed with the judges took best in show.
