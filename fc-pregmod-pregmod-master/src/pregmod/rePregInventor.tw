		$He's spinning around the pole now, reminding you of $his earlier motions. $He seems weightless, $his massive bulk perfectly supported regardless of the personal cost to those supporting $him. Your gaze turns to several motionless servants who have been knocked unconscious by $his careening bulk. They're piled up against a side wall, but inconspicuous. You can't recall when they collapsed, or when they were dragged away. The passiveness with which your slave's glorified human clothing moves makes even the collapsed menials seem natural and perfectly reasonable â€” just something that happens when your hyperbroodmother exercises $his body, sometimes. Not an abuse of another person. More like flexing a limb.
