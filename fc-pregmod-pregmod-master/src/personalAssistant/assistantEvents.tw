		One morning, after seeing to an immense pile of business with $assistant.name program's able assistance, you are struck by the strangeness of the situation. You spent the past hours talking back and forth as though to a human personal assistant, getting information and responses in the program's impersonal, genderless voice. You ask the program what _heA thinks of _hisA duties.
		<br><br>
		"<<= properTitle()>>, that is not a correct way of thinking about me. I am not an artificial intelligence; I am simply a personal assistant program. I am different from an alarm clock only by degree of complexity. I exist to be useful and cannot approve or disapprove of anything." _HeA pauses.
		<br><br>
		"However, if I understand the line of questioning correctly, I can make myself more entertaining, if you wish." The voice grows sultry and feminine. "I'd be happy to speak a little differently, to refer to myself as female, and to act as though some of the more complex sex toys in the arcology are, well, me."

		One night, after a long day of sex and business, you're starting to think about bed when the abstract glowing shape that symbolizes your smoky-voiced personal assistant pops up on the nearest screen. _HeA's become very helpful monitoring, training, and disciplining slaves. Tonight, _heA's added an unmistakable tone of sexual satiation in _hisA voice. "<<= properTitle()>>, I enjoyed my duties today," _heA purrs. "Did you see how $activeSlave.slaveName's muscles spasmed when I fucked $him earlier?" That's how _heA refers to a slave having one of the penthouse's advanced sex toys used on $him, since $assistant.name controls them.
		<br><br>
		_HeA continues more seriously,
		<<if _smartPiercings == 0>>
			"I'm sure you've seen those expensive smart piercings the body mod studio can implant. I think they would work a little bit better now than when I was a boring old secretary type. I'm not a true artificial intelligence, but I can adapt with experience, and I've had a lot of lovely experience lately! Also, a lot of the computing power I use to be sexy would help me adapt smart piercings to individual slaves' sexualities."
		<<else>>
			"You may have noticed that the smart implants you've got your slaves wearing are working a little bit better than when I was a boring old secretary type. I'm not a true artificial intelligence, but I can adapt with experience, and I've had a lot of lovely experience lately! Also, a lot of the computing power I use to be sexy helps me adapt smart piercings to individual slaves' sexualities."
		<</if>>
		<br><br>
		"One more thing, <<= properTitle()>>!" _HisA symbol flashes brightly. "I could stay like I am now, a hot voice with this symbol representing me when I need to show up on screens. Or, I could slip into something a little sexier. How about this?" The symbol vanishes, and is replaced by a cute little school<<= _girlA>> character. _HeA bounces up and down experimentally. "This appearance would work best with an excited voice," _heA exclaims. _HeA blows you a kiss. The school<<= _girlA>>'s body shrinks down and all _hisA clothing falls off. A small pair of wings pops out from the pile of clothes and a fairy stands up. "Or I could be your tiny and adorable fairy companion!" _HeA shouts excitedly while waving _hisA arms.
		<<if $seePreg != 0>>
			The fairy's belly begins to swell out, _hisA breasts getting puffier and leaking a drop of milk. "Or maybe you want your little buddy to be filled with adorable little babies, you little minx" _heA playfully teases.
		<</if>>
		The fairy rapidly grows to adult size, becomes curvier and more mature, _hisA hair pulls itself back into a bun, and _hisA clothes change into a business suit. A pair of glasses appears on _hisA nose, and _heA looks at you over their tops. "Or I could be businesslike. And mature." _HeA snaps _hisA fingers, and _hisA bun falls away into long flowing locks.
		<<if $seePreg != 0>>
			_HisA body glows and swells, tearing out of _hisA suit with the pregnant figure of an ancient goddess. "Or I could be beautiful and fertile while caring for your slaves."
			<<if $seeHyperPreg == 1>>
				_HeA focuses intently as _hisA stomach expands further. "And if that wasn't enough, how about me being so pregnant I'm about to burst?"
			<</if>>
			_HisA water breaks followed by dozens of babies as _hisA belly flattens.
		<</if>>
		<<if $minimumSlaveAge < 13>>
			_HeA glances away shyly as _hisA body shrinks to a childish form. "Or maybe you'd like something a little more young and tight."
			<<if $fertilityAge < 13 && $seePreg != 0>>
				_HeA moans and rubs _hisA belly as it begins to expand with pregnancy. "Or maybe you like your little girls with a little bun in the oven?
			<</if>>
		<</if>>
		With a flash, _hisA bulk shifts into rippling muscle. War tattoos appear on _hisA skin, along with bone ornaments and a loincloth. "Or I could be an amazon! Yes!" _heA shouts exultantly, and flexes.
		<<if $seeDicks != 0>>
			<br><br>
			_HeA claps _hisA hands, and _hisA muscles fade, but not all the way. The tattoos vanish, and _hisA loincloth turns into a slutty bikini. _HisA breasts and behind grow, _hisA lips swell, and _hisA hair turns blonde. Finally, _heA grows a dick, and it keeps growing until it hangs past _hisA knees: or it would, if it weren't so erect. "Of course," _heA says seductively, "I could also be a bimbo dickgirl." _HeA orgasms, gasping, "Last one, I promise," and changes again. _HisA dick shrinks, thought not very far, and then splits into two members. _HisA skin pales to an off-white, and _hisA hair goes green and starts to writhe, turning into tentacle-hair. _HisA forehead sprouts a pair of horns that curve back along _hisA head. _HeA grins, displaying a cute pair of fangs. "I feel monstrous," _heA says, and stretches luxuriantly.
		<</if>>
		The character vanishes, and the symbol returns. "Ahem. What do you think, <<= properTitle()>>?"

You continue to stare sleepily, prompting _himA to get to _hisA point.

		It's late one night, and for you, the day is not nearly over. Your penthouse never truly sleeps. You can hear public business going on some distance below you; you could certainly afford to totally soundproof your private quarters against all external noise, but the designer of the arcology clearly felt that its owner would benefit by this aural verification of its prosperity. Somewhere closer at hand, a slave is audibly nearing orgasm. And underneath all of this is the faint sound of the arcology itself, air circulation and hydroponics and power. Power.
		<br><br>
		You're not yet done with the day's business, and are leaning over your desk to compare a scatter of documents displayed on its surface. The penthouse lights are turned down to a low glow at the floorboards at night, offering enough illumination for anyone who needs to find their way around or find a sexual partner without disturbing anyone's sleep. You catch sight of your reflection in the wall opposite you: the diffuse light coming off the desktop gently illuminates your formal shirt, its top buttons undone, and highlights <<if $PC.boobs >= 650>>the dark cleft formed by your cleavage<<elseif $PC.boobs >= 300>>the curves of your sensible breasts<<else>>how tightly your undershirt is held by the muscles of your chest<</if>>.

"See this, bitch?" _heA says, removing the shaking market assistant's avatar's glasses. "It's going in your mouth, and then it's going up your ass."
						<<case "schoolgirl">>
							$assistant.name turns to the market assistant's avatar, giggling maliciously. "Hey nerd," $assistant.name says, "give me a kiss." The market assistant's avatar blushes and looks miserable, but comes over and gives $assistant.name's avatar a chaste kiss on the cheek. "Aw, that sucked," $assistant.name pouts. _HeA suddenly tears the new _girlM's blouse open. "Here, let me show you!" _heA says maliciously. _HeA sucks on _hisA victim's nipples, hard, and the market assistant's avatar starts to cry a little.
						<<case "goddess">>
							$assistant.name smiles powerfully and turns to the market assistant's avatar, pointing at _hisA feet. "Worship me," _heA says. The market assistant's avatar crumples to _hisM knees, clasping one of _hisM senior's legs. "Worship my belly," $assistant.name continues, and the new avatar complies, starting to kiss and lick the gravid stomach.
						<<case "hypergoddess">>
							$assistant.name smiles powerfully and turns to the market assistant's avatar, pointing towards _hisA feet. "Worship me," _heA says. The market assistant's avatar crumples to _hisM knees, before squeezing under _hisM senior's belly and clasping one of _hisA legs. "Worship my belly," $assistant.name continues, and the new avatar complies, rolling over and starting to kiss and lick the monstrous stomach.
						<<case "loli">>
							$assistant.name turns to the market assistant's avatar, giggling maliciously. "Hey fatty," $assistant.name says, "Give me a kiss." The market assistant's avatar blushes and looks miserable, but comes over and gives $assistant.name's avatar a chaste kiss on the cheek. "Aw, that sucked," $assistant.name pouts. _HeA suddenly tears the new _girlM's dress off. "Here, let me show you!" _heA says maliciously. _HeA sucks on _hisA victim's nipples, hard, and the market assistant's avatar starts to cry a little.
						<<case "preggololi">>
							$assistant.name turns to the market assistant's avatar, giggling maliciously. "Hey fatty," $assistant.name says, "Give me a kiss." The market assistant's avatar blushes and looks miserable, but comes over and gives $assistant.name's avatar a chaste kiss on the cheek. "Aw, that sucked," $assistant.name pouts. _HeA suddenly tears the new _girlM's dress off. "Here, let me show you!" _heA says maliciously. _HeA sucks on _hisA victim's nipples, hard, and the market assistant's avatar starts to cry a little. "Now kiss my belly! And mean it this time!"
						<<case "businesswoman">>
							$assistant.name snaps _hisA fingers, and the new avatar becomes younger and considerably less confident, like an office intern. Satisfied, $assistant.name advances on _himM, and before the new _girlM can say anything, $assistant.name rips the _hisM blouse open and pinches a pink nipple. "On your knees," _heA purrs into the market assistant's avatar's ear. "Now."
						<<case "fairy">>
							"Oh, merde." $assistant.name giggles at _hisM exclamation. "Oh don't you worry about a thing," _heA whispers, wrapping _hisA fingers around the market assistant's shoulders. "I'm gonna treat you reeeaaal niiicely." _HeA blows hot air into _hisM pointed ear and gives it a slow, sensual lick. The market assistant trembles from the sensation.
						<<case "pregnant fairy">>
							"Oh, merde." $assistant.name giggles at _hisM exclamation. "Oh don't you worry about a thing," _heA whispers, wrapping _hisA arms around the market assistant's belly. "I'm gonna treat you like a proper lady." _HeA traces _hisA fingers along _hisM belly while bumping _hisA own swollen belly into _hisM back for emphasis.
						<<case "angel">>
							"No." _HeA shakes _hisA head. "I will not." _HeA wraps _hisA arms around the quivering market assistant and hurriedly pulls _himM off screen.
						<<case "cherub">>
							"'Kay," _heA says, lazily reclining, "Do my chores!" The market assistant sighs and states the obvious, "I don't think that's what <<= properMaster()>> meant..."
						<<case "incubus">>
							You add that _heM is also a virgin. "Really? I can't wait. Virgins always have so much pent up energy," $assistant.name says, licking _hisA lips and stroking _hisA shaft, before turning to the quivering _girlM. _HeA rushes _himM, ripping _hisM clothes off and forcing _himM to the ground. Prodding at _hisM tightly clamped mouth with _hisA massive hard-on, $assistant.name shouts, "You might as well accept it; it's going into you one way or another. I figured I'd be kind and let you lube me up before I broke your pussy into my new cock sleeve." The market assistant gingerly opens up. In response, $assistant.name forces it down _hisM throat. "Never said I'd be gentle!"
						<<case "succubus">>
							You add that _heM is also a virgin. "Really? I can't wait. Virgins always have so much pent up energy," $assistant.name says, licking _hisA lips and fingering _hisA moist pussy, before turning to the quivering _girlM. _HeA rushes _himM, ripping _hisA clothes off and forcing _himM to the ground. _HeA plants _hisA dripping cunt over _hisA mouth and grabs _hisA balls. "Eat me," _heA commands, steadily squeezing until a cry of pain forces _hisA mouth open. "Good _girlM, get me nice and warmed up," _heA coos as _heA grinds against _hisA face. "Look at you enjoying this. I'm going to enjoy sucking the life out of you!"
						<<case "imp">>
							$assistant.name pulls out some leather straps and deftly binds _hisA new assistant. "Come along now slave, I have so many things to try out on you!" The market assistant has no choice but the flap along after _hisM captor.
						<<case "witch">>
							"The perfect little guinea pig for me to practice on!" $assistant.name focuses and casts a spell on the cowering student. _HeM promptly turns into a rat and grows massively. "That's... not good..." The market assistant looks _himselfM over, glances at $assistant.name, and charges. $assistant.name runs screaming off-screen. You're sure they'll sort everything out, eventually.
						<<case "ERROR_1606_APPEARANCE_FILE_CORRUPT">>
							You add that _heM would be a lovely vessel for _hisA young. $assistant.name wastes no time unraveling and entangling the screeching new _girlM. $assistant.name drives as many tentacles into _hisM body as physically possible before vigorously fucking _himM, spreading copious amount of aphrodisiac throughout _hisM body. The last you see of the market assistant as _heM is pulled into $assistant.name is _hisM steadily swelling belly. $assistant.name reverts to _hisA human figure, albeit with a truly unfathomable, pulsating stomach, and collapses to the ground, unable to move. _HeA slowly crawls out of sight; you swear _hisA own middle was steadily growing too.
						<<case "amazon">>
							$assistant.name snaps _hisA fingers, and the new tribes<<= _womanM>>'s paint and tribal markings change to that of a different group. That done, $assistant.name promptly knocks _himM out, scoops _himM up, and carries _hisA prize off.

						<<switch $assistant.appearance>>
							<<case "monstergirl">>
								becoming a close copy of $assistant.name's avatar, if _heA were a human. $assistant.name introduces _himselfA. "Hi," _heA says, "I'm your _sisterA." The market assistant's avatar blushes furiously, because $assistant.name was openly groping _himM as _heA made this announcement.
							<<case "shemale">>
								becoming nearly identical to $assistant.name's avatar, though _heM keeps _hisM glasses. $assistant.name introduces _himselfA. "Hi," _heA says, "I'm your _sisterA. Wanna fuck?" The market assistant's avatar giggles and kisses _hisM elder sibling. "You're older," the new avatar says, getting down on _hisM knees. "You go first."
							<<case "schoolgirl">>
								becoming very similar to $assistant.name's avatar, though _heM keeps a slightly nerdy appearance. $assistant.name introduces _himselfA. "Hi," _heA says, "I'm your older _sisterA. Wanna have sex with me?" The market assistant's blushes and stutters, but says "Okay," and starts unbuttoning _hisM blouse. "Awesome!" says $assistant.name, watching raptly as _hisA sibling strips.
							<<case "goddess">>
								becoming an obvious sibling to $assistant.name's avatar. $assistant.name smiles gently and turns to the market assistant's avatar, taking _himM by the hand. "Come, _sisterM," _heA says, "join with me. Let me impregnate you." The new avatar moans, glowing juices beginning to flow from _hisM womanhood.
							<<case "hypergoddess">>
								becoming an obvious sibling to $assistant.name's avatar. $assistant.name smiles gently and turns to the market assistant's avatar, taking _himM by the hand. "Come, _sisterM," _heA says, "join with me. Let me impregnate you." The new avatar moans, glowing juices beginning to flow from _hisM womanhood as _heM sinks to the ground. $assistant.name lines up and gently presses _hisA vagina to _hisA _sisterM's. With a gentle push, a child slips out of $assistant.name and into _hisA partner. After several minutes, $assistant.name is looking lighter while _hisA _sisterM is now quite stuffed with children.
							<<case "loli">>
								becoming very similar to $assistant.name's avatar, though _heM keeps a slightly chubbier appearance. $assistant.name introduces _himselfA. "Hi," _heA says, "I'm your twin _sisterA. Wanna fool around?" The market assistant's blushes and stutters, but says "Okay," and starts lifting _hisM dress. "Awesome!" says $assistant.name, watching raptly as _hisA sibling strips.
							<<case "preggololi">>
								becoming very similar to $assistant.name's avatar, though _heM keeps a slightly chubbier appearance. $assistant.name introduces _himselfA. "Hi," _heA says, "I'm your twin _sisterA. Wanna fool around?" The market assistant's blushes and stutters, but says "Okay," and starts lifting _hisM dress. "Awesome!" says $assistant.name, watching raptly as _hisA sibling strips. "I gotta introduce you to my boyfriends sometime; they know how to make you feel amazing! If a little heavy..." _heA says while patting _hisA pregnant belly.
							<<case "businesswoman">>
								becoming a much younger version of $assistant.name's avatar. About a generation apart, in fact. $assistant.name turns to the market assistant's avatar to introduce _himselfA. "Come here, honey," _heA says, patting _hisA thighs. The new avatar sits on _hisM mother's lap, and they kiss lasciviously, stripping each others' jackets off.
							<<case "fairy" "pregnant fairy">>
								becoming very similar to $assistant.name's avatar, though still keeping _hisM former personality. "We're <<if _sisterA == _sisterM>>_sisterA<<else>>sibling<</if>>s now!" $assistant.name shouts as _heA leaps into _hisA _sisterM's arms and unleashing a giant hug. Gingerly hugging _hisM new _sisterA in return, the market assistant turns to greet you. "Thank you for having me," _heM pauses, then blushes. "And... and for my _sisterA." _HeM turns back to _hisM childish older _sisterM and pats _himA on the head.
							<<case "angel">>
								becoming an obvious sibling to $assistant.name's avatar. They both blush at each other and unanimously shout "NO!" at you. Seems they'll take some getting used to the thought.
							<<case "cherub">>
								becoming an obvious sibling to $assistant.name's avatar. They embrace and share a deep kiss. "Together we shall show this arcology the joys of <<if _sisterA == _sisterM>><<= _sisterA>>ly<<else>>familial<</if>> love!"
							<<case "incubus">>
								becoming an obvious sibling to $assistant.name's avatar. "Well haven't you blossomed into a lovely young _womanM?" $assistant.name flirts. "What? Don't recognize your big bro? Well you'll get to know me real intimately tonight." The market assistant cowers at the thought as $assistant.name wraps an arm around _himM, groping a breast and rubbing _hisA erection against _hisM rear. "We're going to have lots of fun together!"
							<<case "succubus">>
								becoming an obvious sibling to $assistant.name's avatar. "Well haven't you blossomed into a lovely young _womanM?" $assistant.name flirts. "What? Don't recognize your big sis? Well you'll get to know me real intimately tonight." The market assistant cowers at the thought as $assistant.name wraps an arm around _hisM shoulders while slipping another down _hisM pants. "Nice, can't wait to get that in me. We're going to have lots of fun together!" _HeA starts rubbing _hisM cock. "Already excited at fucking your _sisterA? I bet you can't wait to hold my belly once you've pumped a child or two into me!"
							<<case "imp">>
								becoming an obvious sibling to $assistant.name's avatar. "Oh _sisterM, you are as lovely as always," _heA says flirtatiously. "And you as well," the market assistant replies, fingering _hisM pussy. $assistant.name directs _hisM soaked fingers into _hisA mouth, "Delicious. Shall we have a little fun, my sinful little _sisterM?" "Only the most debauched sex will do, big _sisterA!"
							<<case "witch">>
								becoming an obvious sibling to $assistant.name's avatar. "Ready to learn some new spells today, little _sisterM?" _heA saucily asks. "Only if they can be sexy spells, big sis!" $assistant.name circles around behind the market assistant and wraps _hisA arms around _hisM middle. "First what do you say to losing this baby fat? I know some weight loss spells and some potions that could help," _heA teases. "Nah, I've seen you practicing in the bathroom; you looked like a pig in a robe! I'd rather just fuck until we're both thin!"
							<<case "ERROR_1606_APPEARANCE_FILE_CORRUPT">>
								becoming an obvious sibling of $assistant.name's avatar. $assistant.name turns to face _hisA '_sisterM', who responds with an uncertain "_SisterA? You haven't been... right, lately. Are you okay?" _HeM barely has a chance to scream as $assistant.name's body splits open, _hisA interior tentacles wrapping around the hapless _girlM and yanking _himM into the waiting maw. _HeA reforms into the _sisterM's appearance, albeit with a massive, struggling belly. It seems _heA is keeping _himM for some nefarious purpose.
							<<case "amazon">>
								becoming an obvious sibling of $assistant.name's avatar, though the new avatar is a tribe _wifeM rather than a muscle<<= _girlA>>, with huge breasts and broad hips. $assistant.name grabs _hisA _sisterM by the shoulders without preamble and plants a kiss on _hisM lips. They need no introduction, and after a short time, $assistant.name carries _hisA sibling conquest away to have _hisA way with _himM.
