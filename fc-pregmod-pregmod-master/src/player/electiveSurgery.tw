You arrive at your favorite plastic surgeon for your appointment to find them as busy as ever, but you find yourself quickly hurried into an exam room by their cute assistant. _HeU wastes no time in hurrying you into _hisU office, stripping you down, measuring you and making sure you are healthy enough for surgery, all the while not so subtly running _hisU hands across every part of you. "So, what can I help you with?"

<br><br>
"You sure you want to mess with that lovely face?" _heU teases, caressing your cheek. "@@.yellowgreen;<<print cashFormat(5000)>>.@@ Also wouldn't recommend changing your eyes, face shape or skin color; some security systems get real uppity over things like that. Though I s'pose race and hair can fall under that as well, but hey, we don't handle racial surgery and this isn't a hair salon, so nothing to worry about, right? Yes, I'm certain your systems will recognize you after we finish working on you â€” give us some credit."
