Working in _neighborArcology.name's penthouse office, $subSlave.slaveName gets a video call from you. Naturally, _his2 personal assistant program has been instructed to give these the highest priority, and your face appears in front of _him2 immediately. _He2 greets you properly, and asks you what _he2 can do to serve you. You tell _him2 you're planning to send one of your slaves over to _his2 arcology to assist _him2. Exchanges of this kind are neither unusual nor particularly interesting, so a slight look of perplexity clouds $subSlave.slaveName's face as _he2 wonders why this merits a personal call. Normally, <<if $HeadGirl != 0>>$HeadGirl.slaveName<<else>>$assistant.name<</if>> would handle it with _him2 directly.

$subSlave.slaveName smiles back at $him, glowing with pleasure, and responds with exaggerated arousal.
