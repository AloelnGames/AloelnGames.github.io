<</if>>
The atmosphere of your office is a testament to masculine opulence. Few _womenP in the old world would have the pleasure of completing their work while an attractive $woman flaunts $himself for _hisP pleasure.
You allow the situation to continue for about an hour, before deciding it's time to escalate.
You look up once more at your slave and take some time to review $his dancing performance.
<<if (getSlave($AS).devotion >= -20)>>
	<<if (getSlave($AS).skill.entertainment >= 100)>>
		Your slave has a level of skill previously unseen in the old world. Even $his blinks have the seductive pull of a goddess. As you watch $him perform, you think how no _womanP of the old world would ever get to see pure sexuality like this. And not only do you get to watch $him, you OWN $him. $His body moves like water, with hips that ebb and flow as if the tides themselves panged for a rock hard cock to come and take them. You try to get some work done, but can't take your eyes off $him for even a second. You promise to reward your slave for bringing so much sensuality and beauty into your office; transforming your place of work into a shrine of Masculine dominance.
	<<elseif (getSlave($AS).skill.entertainment >= 60)>>
		$His skill would have only been matched by the best of the best old world erotic dancers, but in your Free City expectations are high. $He dances with seduction in every move, alternating $his style between everything from belly dancing to club twerking, and each with the skill level of a trained professional. You got some work done while $he danced, but often found yourself pulled back in by the tide of $his rolling hips. You praise your slave for $his enriching performance.
	<<elseif (getSlave($AS).skill.entertainment >= 40)>>
		$He has impressive skill and would have been a top-tier dancer in the old world. One of the many benefits of being a leader of a Free City is the ability to work in an atmosphere of pure servitude. You were free to continue your work in an office the old world men could only dream of. You tell your slave that you are pleased with $his show.
	<<elseif (getSlave($AS).skill.entertainment >= 20)>>
		Despite being an average entertainer, it is clear that $he is doing $his best. You enjoyed the sexy ambiance while you worked. You tell your slave that $his performance was adequate.
	<<elseif (getSlave($AS).skill.entertainment >= 10)>>
		$He is still learning the nuances of seductive dance, but at least able to move with the rhythm. You spent much of the performance distracted, forgetting that $he was even there at times and leaving $him unable to stop until you remembered about $him. You tell $him that $he will have to work harder if $he wishes to please you.
	<<else>>
		Or, at least, $his best attempt at dancing. $His arms flail about awkwardly as $he crouches and straightens off-beat to the music. You spent much of the dance ignoring $him and working on your business. You chide your slave for such a pathetic excuse for a performance, and tell $him that $he will have to find a place to please you, or you will be forced to make $him useful, turning $his thoughts to the arcades, dairies, and Fuckdolls common amongst the Free Cities.
	<</if>>
<<else>>
	$He dances poorly on purpose to spite you. Whatever skills $he has, they are not on display here. You threaten to
	<<switch getSlave($AS).rules.punishment>>
	<<case "confinement">>
		lock $him up in the bad-<<= $girl>> box
	<<case "whipping">>
		whip $him until $he screams

It's not over yet, though. You tell your slave that it's time to incorporate some stripping into $his dance.

<<if (getSlave($AS).sexualFlaw == "shamefast")>>
	<<if (getSlave($AS).devotion <= 40)>>
		$He immediately begins to tear up at the thought of being naked. $His shame is obvious to you, and you remind $him that $his comfort is not your concern.

			Even though $he is crippled by shame, your slave is a masterful entertainer, able to keep anyone entertained for even the most lengthy of strip teases. With tears still streaming down $his face, $he begins by writhing $his hips and rolling $his ass. $He knows how to use $his hips and ass to draw and keep your attention while slowly moving up to $his chest. $His body is nothing more than an object for your desire, and $he knows how to fulfill $his purpose, even as $he sniffles at the shame of revealing $himself for you. You keep trying to get back to work, but your slave's movements are so enthralling that you cannot seem to break free.

		<<elseif (getSlave($AS).skill.entertainment >= 10)>>
			Your slave is not a skilled performer, and $his movements are uninspired. $He is too concerned with protecting $his nakedness to be obedient and attractive simultaneously, and you find yourself becoming distracted, $his dance not enough to keep your attention or draw you back.

		<<else>>
			Your slave has no skills to speak of, and isn't able to keep even the simplest of rhythms. $He fumbles about awkwardly and clumsily, stopping abruptly every so often to reluctantly, but obediently, remove an article of clothing.
