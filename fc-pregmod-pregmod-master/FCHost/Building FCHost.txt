BUILD REQUIREMENTS

The below requirements must be met to build this project.

 - Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) 76.1.5 or newer.  The windows build is
   currently configured to operate with the X64 binary distribution of CEF.

 - CMake version 2.8.12.1 or newer.

 - Linux/MacOS requirements:
   I haven't tested these platforms, and there is platform-specific code missing.
   Shouldn't be too hard to add, check the CEF distribution and treat FCHost
   as a derivative of tests/cefsimple.

 - Windows requirements:
   Visual Studio 2015 or newer.

BUILD STEPS

You must have the environment variable CEF_ROOT set to the root of your
CEF distribution.

If you are running Windows, execute cmake_vs2015.bat, open FCHost.sln, and
build from there.  Resulting binary and support files will be in
FCHost/fchost/Debug, or FCHost/fchost/Release depending on the configuration
selected in Visual Studio.  You should be able to zip up the contents of the
Release folder and distribute them to another machine or user if desired.

If you are not running Windows or you need something else special, please
familiarize yourself with CMake and see the detailed information in CMakeLists.txt.
